A 17-year-old school dropout, on Friday, told a Jikwonyi Customary Court, Abuja, that her sister’s husband forcibly had sexual intercourse with her, and two other sisters. The teenager, who resides in Minna, gave the testimony as a witness in a divorce petition filed by her elder sister, Janet Suleman, against her husband, Philip Ogho. “When I was living with my sister, her husband attempted to sleep with me, but I never agreed. Whenever I refused, he would beat me. One day he asked me who I am, that he can’t have sex with me, that he has sex with my other two sisters living with them,” she testified. The witness said that her sister’s husband kept on maltreating her until she gave in to his request. “He kept on beating me, then one day I could not bear it again, so I allowed him to sleep with me. He threatened to deal with me if I tell my sister. I didn’t tell my sister but I told the other two he had sex with,” she told the court. She told the court that she left her sister’s house because her brother-in-law kept coming to have sex with her every night. The Court’s President, Everyman Eleanya, however, ordered that a hearing notice be placed at Ogho’s residence because of his continued absence in court since the commencement of hearing in the case. Eleanya thereafter adjourned the case till January 31 for hearing.
