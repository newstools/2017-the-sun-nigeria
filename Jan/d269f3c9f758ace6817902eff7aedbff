The media screening of American crime drama, Live By Night, shot and directed by American movie star, Ben Afleck held on Thursday, January 12, at Silverbird Cinemas, Ikeja, Lagos. A 2016 American crime drama based on the 2012 novel of the same title by Dennis Lehane, Live By Night also stars Elle Fanning, Brendan Gleeson, Chris Messina, Sienna Miller, Zoe Saldana and Chris Cooper. According to Miss Bidemi, a guest at the screening: “In many crime drama films we have seen from Hollywood, there is usually some form of exaggeration that causes the audience to gasp knowing that what they have just seen is-make-belief but Live By Night is totally different. Watching the movie makes you feel like you are in it with the casts. You are totally lost in time and sold out till the movie is over.” Blue Picture’s CEO, Mrs. Joy Ilibeno-Odiete was evidently impressed by the positive reaction from the audience. Commenting she said: “We have always known that the audience would love this film but we didn’t envisage that the love would be this overwhelming. I am so happy right now and this shows how great this movie would do when it hits the cinemas across Nigeria on Friday, January 20, 2017.”
