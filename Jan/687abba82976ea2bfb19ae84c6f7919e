From Molly Kilete. Abuja Confusion last night trailed the reported raid of the home of brother to former First Lady, Mrs. Patience Jonathan, in Abuja. While report indicates that security operatives stormed the Maitama District home of Mrs. Jonathan’s brother, the police denied being aware or involved in it. It was gathered that security agents, in three pick-up vehicles, stormed the building late afternoon, but found nobody at home. They, however, broke into the house and conducted a search. Reacting yesterday, the police could not confirm or deny the raid. Force Spokesman, Don Awunah, in a telephone interview, said he could not tell if, indeed, those who carried out the raids were policemen. Awunah said he made inquiries, but could not confirm if the police were involved in the raid. He was, however, quick to add that the police often support other security agencies in various raids and operations. According to him, “I have made inquiries, but I didn’t get any positive confirmation that our men were involved in the said operation. But we often support other law enforcement agencies in various operations. So, I can’t say, categorically, that the police were not involved in the alleged operation.” It was gathered that the raid of the home of Mrs. Jonathan’s brother is the third carried out against people linked to the former first lady since the EFCC discovered the foreign currency in her bank accounts. Mrs Jonathan has been having a running battle with the EFCC over $15 milion allegedly discovered in her account. A high court in Lagos recently ordered that the account be frozen.
