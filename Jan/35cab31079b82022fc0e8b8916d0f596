Two-time Academy Award-winner Denzel Washington says he has experienced the lack of diversity at the Oscars firsthand. When the 61-year-old star was asked what he thinks about ongoing criticism over the lack of diversity at the Oscars, he said he doesn’t have to think about it much because ;he has lived it,’ reported Entertainment Weekly. “I’ve been the guy at the Oscars without my name being called. I’ve been the guy at the Oscars when my name is called. I’ve been the guy at the Oscars when everybody thought they were going to call my name and they didn’t. So, I’ve lived it,” Washington said. For the past two years, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has nominated only white performers in its four main categories, igniting the controversy known as #OscarsSoWhite.
