From Basil Obasi, Abuja In line with its commitment to deliver affordable housing to Nigerians through the Integrated National Housing Plan in the coming years, the Federal Government has voted over N1billion in the 2017 budget to set up a social housing fund to boost housing delivery in the country. The Minister of Budget and National Planning, Senator Udoma  Udo  Udoma, disclosed this yesterday in Abuja, when stakeholders from the Housing and Urban Development Working Team of the  National Economic Summit Group (NESG), led by Pemwalk  Gomwalk, paid him a courtesy in his office in Abuja. In a statement signed by the Acting Director of Information in the ministry, Ben Bem Goong, the Minister explained that government places premium on housing and urban development in the 2017 budget, hence it voted a whopping N1 billion to achieving the goal. While acknowledging the funding constraints in realising the goal of meeting the country’s housing deficit, the Minister challenged NESG to mobilise the private sector to complement government’s efforts by investing in the housing sector, adding it is a good window to invest in. Speaking earlier, the leader of the Housing and Urban Development Working Team of NESG, Pemwalk Gomwalk, told Udoma that the group is working hard to mobilise the private sector to partner government to ensure that the objectives of the Integrated National Housing Plan are fully realised.
