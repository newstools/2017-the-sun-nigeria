From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja and Dickson Okafor The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu will not defect to All Progressives Congress (APC). The party also said Ekweremadu will continue to retain his seat as he was elected through majority votes of both PDP and APC senators. The PDP stated this, yesterday, in reaction to the call by Senator Kabiru Marafa on the Deputy Senate President to defect to the APC, so as to retain his position in the leadership of the Senate. Marafa, while speaking on the floor of the Senate on Wednesday, had called on Ekweremadu to join the APC if he still wants to keep his position in the Red Chamber. In a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Prince Dayo Adeyeye, the opposition party stated that Ekweremadu was elected as deputy senate president by majority of senators and noted that any attempt to force him out of office, merely because he belongs to the PDP, will be an invitation to anarchy. Meanwhile, a claim by Senator Ndume that Ike Ekweremadu is on the list of those to be removed has been criticised by groups and individuals across the country. Reacting to Ndume’s allegation, Dynamic Youth Organisation of Nigeria (DYON), warned those behind the plot to desist, henceforth. Rising from an emergency meeting, yesterday, in its Apapa headquarters in Lagos, the group in a communiqué signed by its National President, Chief Elvis Obiekwe, warned APC Caucus in the senate to allow sleeping door lie. The group called on the lawmakers to continue to support Senator Bukola Saraki–led Upper Chamber for the sake of equity, justice and fair play.
