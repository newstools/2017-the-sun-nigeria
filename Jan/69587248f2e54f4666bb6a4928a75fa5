Madagascar Football Federation head, Ahmad Ahmad says the quest fora desirable change in the administration of African football, is the reason he is challenging Issa Hayatou to the CAF Presidency seat.
Hayatou,  who has led the African football governing body since 1988 is  seeking  an eight term re-election as the Continental body’s President.
I took my decision after hearing some federation presidents say they want change,” Ahmad, told the BBC.
“After the Africa Cup of Nations, I am going to organize a press conference to show my programme.
“I expect some federations to support me.”
Ahmad’s decision to stand comes as the CAF announced Madagascar had been stripped of hosting rights for this year’s Under-17 African Cup of Nations, with the body now actively seeking a replacement.
The elections are due to take place on March 16 in Ethiopia’s capital city Addis Ababa.
Hayatou has only been challenged on two previous occasions for the Presidency and prevailed on both occasions, with the FIFA vice-president having won the last election in 2013 unopposed.
He is able to stand again after CAF voted to change their statutes in 2015 which previously stopped officials serving past the age of 70.
CAF rules dictate that the presidency is limited to three four-year terms, but with the ruling having only come into force in September, allows Hayatou to stand again.
