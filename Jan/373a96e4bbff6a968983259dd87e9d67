From Tony Osauzo, Benin Oba of Benin, Ewuare  II, has read the riot act to Enigie, Edionweres and Ohens in his domain, following allegation of connivance between them and some youths to perpetuate activities of the banned Communities Development Associations (CDAs) under the guise of new leadership structures. The Oba, who has embarked on a seven-day visit to some of the communities in his domain, read the riot act at Use, Egor Local Government Area while addressing Edionweres,  Enigies, Ohens and other stakeholders. Daily Sun gathered that the riot act became necessary as  the Oba was said to have discovered that some Enigies and Odionweres were setting up various leadership structures to replace the CDAs  in their various communities, a move the Omo N’Oba described as deceptive and fraudulent. The Benin monarch had, earlier, removed the powers of the CDAs and reinstated Odionweres and Enigies as those recognised by the Bini traditional law on land transactions and other related matters. The Oba also disclosed that  it will  provide jobs to many unemployed youths that would be engaged in the farms. He thanked Egor traditional rulers and leaders for their support during his coronation ceremony. ‎
