Newly signed –on Enyimba International Football Club of Aba and experienced Ghana goalkeeper Fatau Dauda has been cut from Ghana’s squad for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations.
Dauda made a return to the team and trained with his colleagues at the St Thomas Aquinas School Park before the turn of the year but his efforts were deemed unsatisfactory.
The last time he played for the Black Stars in the game against Mauritius.
Dauda was seeking to make his fourth Africa Cup of Nations campaign and has featured at the last two.
Also affected is Juventus attacker Kwadwo Asamoah as Avram Grant excluded him from his provisional 26-man squad on Monday.
Asamoah was reported to have made himself unavailable last month following his comeback from a knee injury and his absence was confirmed by Grant.
Leicester City’s Jeffrey Schlupp is also missing from the squad, while Kevin-Prince Boateng and Sulley Muntari – thought to have been asked to be considered – were also not included.

Boateng and Muntari were also omitted in 2015 after being sent home from the 2014 World Cup and suspended over alleged indiscipline.
Star names Asamoah Gyan and Andre Ayew did make the cut and are joined by a trio of uncapped youngsters.
