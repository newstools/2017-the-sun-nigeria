That this indigene of Kogi State has carved a niche for herself as a leading actress in Nollywood is not in doubt. Beginning with a minor role in Rejected in 2001, today, the actress known as Halima Abubakar is definitely a force to be reckoned with in the Nigerian motion picture industry. Indeed, she has every reason to be happy with the success in Nollywood. However, it seems that some people out there are bent on getting on her nerves and the question on every lip right now is who is putting pressure on Halima for marriage? Recently, an angry Halima had posted the following message on her twitter handle: “Don’t allow Africans force you into marriage. The blame will be on you if the marriage fails. No hurry in and out.” Halima later added another post, which read thus: “No one will understand your reasons, so do yourself a huge favour and keep your relationship private. When you honestly love someone, you don’t fall out of love#Respect.”
