From Petrus Obi, Enugu In the face of increasing rate of unemployment and economic uncertainty in the country the Vice Chancellor of Godfrey Okoye University (GOU) in Enugu State, Professor Christian Aniek,  has suggested the teaching of trade and skills in tertiary schools in the country to enhance the quality of graduates and equip them to be self reliant. Professor Anieke, who was speaking at the 8th matriculation ceremony of 500 new students into different departments in the university, expressed the need for skilled graduates who on their own can become employers of labour rather than endless wait for un-existing white-collar-jobs. “For us in Godfrey Okoye University the vision is to produce graduates who will be outstanding in learning, balanced in character and personality ready to pursue epistemic unity in all ramifications. “In order to realize this vision, we have borrowed a leaf from traditional education where education is targeted at helping people become responsible citizens of their community by learning the trades and skills available in the community.” He noted that as the first catholic university in Africa and one of the fastest growing university in Nigeria, the institution has been aided by stronger ties and partnership between the institution and foreign universities.
