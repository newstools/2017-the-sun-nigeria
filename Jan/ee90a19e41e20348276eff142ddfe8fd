BY PAUL EREWUBA Super Eagles players and their technical crew may have to keep an eye on indomitable Lions duo of Ambroise Oyongo and Christian Bassogog ahead of the World Cup qualifiers in August.
The duo who will be on duty for Cameroon at the 2017 AFCON in Gabon have continued to display super form which coach Hugo Broos believes will ultimately rub off on the World Cup qualifiers.
The duo grabbed two goals in 11 minutes as the Lions handed DR Congo a 2-0 defeat in a friendly played at the Stade Omnisport Ahmadou Ahidjo on Thursday as part of the shape up for AFCON kick off  next Saturday.
Oyongo a left back who plies his trade with MLS side Montreal Impact equally scored in his side’s 3-2 defeat of Toronto FC just before his call for national assignment.
Bassogog on the other hand who plays in the midfield for Danish club AaB incidentally scored the only goal that saw the side defeat Lyngby last month.
There are indications that Coach Broos hopes to use them to spring surprises while attention of would be opponents remain on regular strikers.
Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr who is scheduled to be in Gabon for the AFCON, will no doubt have his eyes on Oyongo and Bassagog among others in the Cameroon line up and Riyad Mahrez who few hours ago emerged African Footballer of the year on the Algerian’s side.
Cameroon occupy the second position in Group B of the qualifiers with just two points behind Nigeria while Algeria Zambia have a point each.
