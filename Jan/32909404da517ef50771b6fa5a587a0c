Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, has arrived in London, ostensibly oj the invitation of the Metropolitan Police. It was gathered that the London trip was not to see President Muhammadu Buhari, as speculated. But online publication, Sahara Repoters, claimed that Idris’s London trip was on the invitation of the Metropolitan Policeand not to see the president. The IGP was accompanied by: DIG in charge Finance and Administration, Mr Shuiabu Gambo, Commissioner of Police in Charge Monitoring Unit, CP Umar Garba and other top ranking officers. The disturbing report on Buhari’s health was alleged by fake Metro (UK) site that “quoted” the Nigerian mission in the country as confirming the president’s death. The report claimed that President Buhari visited the UK for medical check over an unknown disease adding that details of his death were still sketchy. But in his reaction, Garba Shehu, the Buhari’s spokesperson, said: “He is alive and well! President Buhari is not magical. He cannot be holidaying in the UK and be in Germany, dead or alive at the same time.
