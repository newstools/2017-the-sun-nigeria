Following the report of the Director of Public Prosecutions of January 25, 2013, Alhaji Welewa, Okoghiroh Endurance, Ozioma Abajuo and Chigozie Evans Samuel, were granted bail because they had no prima facie case of murder against them.

The trial judge, Justice Letam Nyordee, while delivering the judgement, discharged and acquitted Segun, Endurance, Abajuo Samuel and the traditional ruler. Justice Nyordee freed the accused persons after the Director of Public Prosecutions filed a submission of no case on the five persons to the court, saying they had no case to answer in the matter. He ruled that no prima-facie case was established against the five persons and set them free. Meanwhile, the remaining seven accused persons are still facing trial and the matter has been adjourned till February 9, 2017, for continuation.
