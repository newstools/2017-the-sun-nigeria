.. Sets sight on continental ticket Rivers United goalkeeper, Sunday Rotimi, has insisted that the rumours making the rounds that he is planning to retire from the beautiful game is a ruse after all. According to the goalie “Im not planning to quit football now. The former El-Kanemi Warriors goalkeeper said this after his side’s lone goal victory against visiting Niger Tornadoes at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium in Port Harcourt. Rotimi said he was looking forward to working hard and seeing Rivers United surpass their achievement of 2016 in the current season. “I am not planning to retire yet. My commitment is with Rivers United at the moment. It is very encouraging that we have started the season on a good note, because we have a continental tax ahead of us in the next few weeks. For me, all that is important now is to keep doing my best for the team and keep helping them win games, retiring is out of context for now,” he stressed. On the arrival of Femi Thomas and the threat that the former Enyimba goalkeeper poses to his place in the team, Rotimi said he was not bothered about competition for a place in the team, but rather focused on improving his form and fitness level. “I have to do more and work hard. What keeps me going is that I maintain strict discipline and work to improve my fitness on and off the pitch at all times. I am working extra hard to see that I keep my form, which is very important to the team and me as an individual. Being a goalkeeper of my status is very challenging. Despite the competition in the team, we must forge ahead as a unit,” he said. Rotimi has been in fine form since the beginning of the season, helping Rivers United amass points.
