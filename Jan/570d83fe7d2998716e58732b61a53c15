Former governor of Abia State and a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, has advised Igbos to concentrate their efforts in agitation for a fair share of the national cake. He also said Igbos have what it takes to produce the president. Kalu, who spoke in his country home in Igbere, Abia State recently, said Igbos need to work together to get what they truly deserve in Nigeria. He urged members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to join other Igbos in this regard. He said former Biafra leader, Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, had told him years before his demise that if he were to fight the Biafra cause all over again, he would have handled it differently. The former governor said: “Severally, I was with the late  Ojukwu in this house  before his  death. I can’t disclose in public everything we discussed, but If  the leader, who pressed for Biafra went to contest for Senate, went to contest for Nigerian president, we should define what our Biafra should be.  Our Biafra should be good roads, equality in the nation, respect for human rights, atmosphere for respect for the rule of law and not killing people unnecessarily without the rule of law,” he said. On the Presidency, he says the South-East has what it takes to produce it. According to him, the greatest thing anybody can do is to give the Igbo the Presidency of Nigeria after President Muhammadu Buhari. Giving an appraisal of the media, Kalu said: “The Nigerian media had been very vibrant and this has made us one of the strongest in Africa.”
