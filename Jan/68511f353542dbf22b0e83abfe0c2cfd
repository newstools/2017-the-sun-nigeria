From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure Presiding Pastor of Latter Rain Assembly, Pastor Tunde Bakare, has declared that the achievements recorded by the outgoing Governor of Ondo State in his eight years administration would be difficult to surpass by his successors. Speaking at the commissioning of projects executed by Mimiko in Akure, the state capital, Bakare stated that Governor Mimiko followed the pattern of the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo in governance. He also predicted a great future for the state, saying the Mega Primary Schools built across the state by Governor Mimiko would serve as foundation of leadership for upcoming generation in the state. He said Mimiko followed the pattern of Chief Awolowo in the area of educational development of children in Ondo State. Bakare who said his mind was blown away seeing what looked like a University campus structure commissioned as primary school, said he had never seen any Mega Primary School like the one in the state in any of the South West states. “I have been to Lagos, Oyo, Ogun, I need not bother to go to Osun and I had not been to Ekiti State. There is nothing like this in any other states in the South West,” he stated. He commended Governor Mimiko for not allowing his mind to shrink even after the November 26, 2016 governorship election held in the state, adding that it is only God that can reward him (Mimiko). Commissioning the project, Mimiko said Mega Primary Schools constitute a deliberate investment in education to tackle inequality in the society and ensure social integration in the society.
