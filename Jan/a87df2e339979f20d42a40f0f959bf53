From Paul Osuyi, Asaba A Delta State High Court sitting in Asaba has ordered the state government and the Oshimili South Local Government to stop further release of five percent monthly stipends to monarchs  within the council area to the Asagba of Asaba, Obi Joseph Chike Edozien. The court presided over by the state Chief Judge, Justice Marshal Umukoro also restrained agents, servants and privies of both the state and local governments from releasing such money meant for Oshimili South traditional rulers to the first class monarch. Instead, Justice Umukoro ordered that such unpaid fund  to monarchs in Oshimili South should be paid to the assistant director of the state High Court, Asaba who shall deposit the same into an interest yielding account in either Union Bank Plc, UBA Plc or Zenith Bank Plc, all in Asaba. Justice Umukoro handed down the orders in a ruling in respect of the suit and motion in notice for an order of interlocutory injunction instituted by Anthony Onwuka, the Akor of Oko Anala. Onwuka, a recognised traditional ruler in the state, was presented with a staff of office on December 29, 2012 by the state government. The claimant had contended that between December 2012 and May 2016, the Asagba of Asaba converted the monies due to the traditional rulers in Oshimili South solely to himself, thereby depriving the claimant of his rights and legitimate earnings as a recognised monarch. The claimant further stated that efforts made to make the Asagba do the proper thing met brick walls, hence the recourse to the judicial process. Delivering the ruling, Justice Umukoro who cited several judicial authorities and the supporting affidavit coupled with the address of the claimant’s counsel, held that it was fair to temporarily stop the release of the monies due to traditional rulers in the locality to the Asagba pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit. He, thereafter, adjourned the substantive suit to February 16.
