From George Onyejiuwa, Owerri A former governor of Abia state and eminent businessman, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu has admonished State governors to stop  wasting money on exotic cars and rather use such funds to provide social infrastructure for their people. Kalu, who said he never used bullet-proof cars throughout his tenure as chief Executive of Abia state and even after he left office, added that such fund could be used in the provision of basic amenities for the state. The former governor stated this in Okwu community in Ikeduru council area of Imo State last Tuesday during the commissioning and handing over of a Catholic church building built by Chuka Odom, former  Minister of state, Federal Capital Territory. “As the governor of Abia State, I never used bullet proof cars. Even up till now, I am not using bullet proof cars. I made use of buses as governor and I am still using buses up till now,” Kalu said. “I don’t believe anybody can kill me except God. Instead of spending huge money in buying expensive bullet proof cars, governors should use the money to provide electricity for their people,” he said. Also speaking at the event former governor of Imo State, Chief  Ikedi Ohakim, said “there is hope for the country.” Ohakim said irrespective of political party affiliation, all Nigerians must, because of patriotism, support the President to succeed, because “if he fails, everybody has failed.” Meanwhile, Catholic Archbishop of Owerri archdiocese, Anthony Obinna, described the killings in Southern Kaduna as an orchestrated war to wipe out Christians in the country. The prelate raised the alarm that if the crisis is not checkmated, it would degenerate into a serious national challenge. He tasked President Muhammadu Buhari to quickly ensure that those involved in the dastardly act are brought to book.
