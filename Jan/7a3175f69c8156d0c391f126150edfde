In what may be described as a ‘shock and awe’ operation, Tony Okoroji’s new single, Happy Music took the airwaves by storm last weekend when radio stations in Lagos unleashed Happy Music to wide acclaim in the yuletide. The song, which caused a stir is the first single released in many years by the former president of PMAN. Meanwhile, the video of Happy Music which was shot at Philip Trimnell’s Chakaville Beach Resort is already in circulation. The hot ‘Happy Music’ video which features vivacious dancers is set to rock the Nigerian music scene. Commenting, Okoroji said: “While all hands at Tops are on deck coordinating the roll out of Happy Music, every system is being readied for an explosive introduction to the world of the Nigerian music industry’s recent most talked about songstress, Kasi, the June 12 Girl, who will on Saturday, January 14 simultaneously drop two big singles Lovingitis and Ifunaya. “I am 100 per cent confident that Kasi will rock the world and Tops is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that the June 12 Girl, the first lady of Tops gets a roll out like no other. “With an abundance of talents, Topswill be a significant player in entertainment production, distribution, publishing and events organization across Nigerian in 2017 and beyond,” Okoroji added.
