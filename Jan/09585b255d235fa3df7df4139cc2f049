From FRED ITUA, Abuja The Senate, on Tuesday, frowned at the alleged refusal by the Federal Government to pay some federal Judges their four-month salary arrears. Accordingly, two committees, Finance and Judiciary, have been mandated to investigate the claims and ensure that the salary arrears are paid promptly. The two committees are also expected to report back next Tuesday for further legislative action. The decision of the Senate, followed a motion moved by the Deputy Leader of the Senate, Senator Bala Na’Allah. The motion came under Matters of Urgent National Importance. Na’Allah, while speaking, said the non-payment of the Judges was unhealthy for the country. He urged his colleagues to intervene and act swiftly to ensure that incidences like this do not occur, going forward.
