• We’ll respond appropriately –Expelled senator’s aide From Joe Effiong, Uyo Akwa Ibom State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has expelled one of its members and former minister of state for the FCT, Senator John Akpanudoedehe for alleged anti-party offences. But Udoedehe, as he is popularly called, has  promised to respond appropriately to the expulsion, saying he was putting his arsenal together. The letter of expulsion, signed by the state chairman of the party, Dr. Amadu Atai and 60 other party executives as well as elders yesterday, said the action was sequel to an earlier suspension and dismissal from the party effected on the former governorship candidate by his ward and Uyo chapter of the party. Bu, spokesman for the senator, Mr. Ata Etuk, said they are preparing appropriate response to the expulsion as many of the signatories to the letter were fake. “When our response is ready, tomorrow, I will let you know and I will let you have it,” he said.
