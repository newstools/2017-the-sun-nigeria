In a bid to mitigate the incidence of flooding, the Lagos State Government on Sunday ordered owners of property erected on drainage channels and impeding the free-flow of water to immediately vacate or risk being removed.
The government, in a statement signed by Commissioner for the Environment, Babatunde Adejare, expressed dismay that the lawless activities of some people was constantly putting the lives and property of residents at risk.
He listed some of the areas where property were erected on drainage channels to include Illubirin, Dolphin Estate, Osborne Foreshore Estate, Ikoyi, Osapa London, Ikota, Ogombo and Lekki, noting that the massive investment of public fund into drainage clearing and de-silting had been compromised by structures hindering free-flow of water.
The commissioner said the state government was seriously concerned that man-made causes, particularly impediment of free-flow of storm water through indiscriminate erection of buildings on drainage alignments/right of way and water courses, have played a major role in the recent experience of flooding in the state.
“Therefore, it is now of paramount importance that owners of buildings or structures impeding free-flow of storm water, wherever they exist in the state, are advised to voluntarily quit forthwith in the overriding public interest or risk being removed by the government as no responsible government will allow interest of a few to jeopardise the wellness and well-being of the generality of its people.
“In view of the grievous consequences of compromising drainage right of way and alignment, Lagosians are hereby warned to henceforth refrain from this illegal act, report perpetrators and cooperate with the Lagos State Government in its bid to achieve a flood-free, clean and liveable state,” Adejare said.
The commissioner also disclosed that the state Government has resolved to re-establish the right of way of drainage infrastructure across the state to stem the tide of flooding.
He said the decision became necessary to enhance the ability of the drainage channels to effectively discharge storm water into the rivers, lagoon and other water bodies and relieve Lagosians of the incidence of flood.
