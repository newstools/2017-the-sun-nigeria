Intense controversy and war of words have lately been raging between the leadership of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohaneze Ndigbo, over the authentic leadership of Ndigbo in the context of the current socio-political quagmire in which the Nigerian State has recently found herself. It is needless to emphasize the point that Ndigbo as a people could not afford the luxury of dissipating their energy on frivolities and pursing shadows when the present air of uncertainty and extremely dangerous situation pervading the Nigerian political landscape urgently demand the collective and concerted efforts by the various groups in the struggle for the emancipation of Ndigbo and their survival under the extremely hostile and unpredictable Nigerian environment. All well-meaning sons and daughters of Ndigbo must rise up to the occasion and quickly come to terms with the present realities to the effect that Ndigbo today are at a crossroads and confronted with unimaginable challenges in the country called Nigeria. The common Igbo adage that says: ‘Onye be ya na-agba oku, adighi achu oke’ should be a wake-up call for the various Igbo groups to immediately come together and speak with one voice rather than the present discordant voices among Igbo leaders and mindless pursuit of selfish interest and personal ego which do not serve the collective interest of Ndigbo. Another Igbo adage that says quote: ‘onye ndi iro gbara gburugburu na eche ndu ya nche oge n’ile’ is yet another maxim that should spur the Igbo leaders across the entire spectrum to engage themselves in a pro-active diplomacy as the unfolding political developments continue to play out in the country. The leadership of various Igbo organizations that are presently championing the struggle for the emancipation of Ndigbo should, however, realize that circumstances or rather exigencies of the current situation in the country had thrust upon them the onerous task of piloting the affairs of Ndigbo and since they were never democratically elected by the generality of Ndigbo, none of them, including Ohaneze, should arrogate to themselves or claim the position of pre-eminence or  superiority over other Igbo groups. All hands must, therefore, be on deck to enable Ndigbo confront squarely their common foes which are criminal marginalization, subjugation and defeatist mentality in a nation they had called their own country.

And as events are rapidly unfolding, Ndigbo as a people, must be prepared to take their destiny in their hands by demanding for self-determination through an organized referendum to finally decide their own future once and for all in this utterly defective and unworkable Nigerian project.
