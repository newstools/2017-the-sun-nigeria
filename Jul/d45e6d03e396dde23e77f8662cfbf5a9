From: Laide Raheem, Abeokuta The Ogun State Government has declared that worship centres, factories and high-rise buildings would not be considered for certification under the Homeowners’ Charter scheme. Governor Ibikunle Amosun said this while speaking at the distribution of Certificates of Occupancy to another set of 1,000 beneficiaries of the homeowners’ charter scheme, held at the Arcade Ground, Oke Mosan, Abeokua. He also disclosed that over 13,000 C-of-Os had been delivered so far to successful applicants. The governor, who was represented by his Chief of Staff, Tolu Odebiyi, stressed his administration was committed to empowering residents through the scheme. He said: “When you have a C-of-O, it entitles you to many opportunities: one, you have absolute control over your property; secondly, you have something to pass on to your family and thirdly, you have an opportunity to raise funds to engage in any business or raise fund to educate your children”. The governor, however, urged applicants with incomplete documentation to come forward and correct it in order to access their title documents re-echoing his charge to members of the public to expose corrupt officials, demanding bribes and unauthorised charges in the programme. Also speaking, the Director-General, Ogun State Bureau of Lands and Survey, Biyi Ismail, said efforts were ongoing to scale up the monthly distribution of title documents to 4,000 applicants. Meanwhile, the state government, according to the DG,  had set a fresh deadline of August 31, 2017 for those whose properties have not been inspected to make themselves available for required site inspection.
