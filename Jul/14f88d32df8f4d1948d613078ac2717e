mr. Sunday Esan, General Manager, Corporate Communications, Dangote Group has been unraveled by his close associate as a very popular social crawler, a man that enjoys life to the fullest. If you have ever met him enjoying himself at a party, you would wonder how this man combines work life and societal swag seamlessly . Society Gists gathered reliably that this feat has only been possible for the corporate guru with the help and support of his wife of many years. The pictures above speak volumes on how the man behind Okiki Productions was looking while he was still struggling to make it. His wife, Madam Esan Omowumi Altine, stood by him during those trying times and today they are among the most blessed and influential couples in the country. We gathered that they had both laboured together and are now enjoying together, they starved together, now they are eating together. She stood by her husband all the way and now she stands as a pillar of his success story today. If what our source hinted us was anything to go by, we understand she now calls the shots at Sunday Esanâ€™s production outfit Okiki Films.
