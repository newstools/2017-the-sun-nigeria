(BBC) North Korea has hailed as a success its latest test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), describing it as a “stern warning” for the US. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said the test proved that the entire US was within striking range, state media reported. The launch came three weeks after North Korea’s first ICBM test. US President Donald Trump called it “only the latest reckless and dangerous action by the North Korean regime”. China also condemned the missile test but urged “all parties concerned” to exercise restraint “and avoid intensifying tensions”.  Confirming the launch, the North said the ICBM flew for just over 47 minutes and reached an altitude of 3,724km (2,300 miles). It said the launch had “successfully tested re-entry capabilities” of the missile. “The leader said proudly the test also confirmed all the US mainland is within our striking range,” the Korean Central News Agency said. The statement said that the rocket was a Hwasong-14, the same model North Korea tested on 3 July.
