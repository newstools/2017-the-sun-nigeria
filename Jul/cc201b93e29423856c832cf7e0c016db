The Enugu State Government has approved N25 million for the purchase of non sensitive materials, preparatory to the conduct of local government election in the state.
The Commissioner of Information, Dr Godwin Udeuhele, made the disclosure in Enugu on Thursday while addressing journalists on the outcome of the state executive council meeting. He said the council also approved the payment of 2017 accommodation and furniture allowances for new members of the Enugu State Independent Electoral Commission (ENSIEC).
Udeuhele also said that the state government was poised to support ENSIEC in the conduct of the local government election expected to hold before the end of the year.
He said that the money would be released in tranches due to paucity of funds.
“The approved sum is to enable ENSIEC start the purchase of non sensitive materials contained in its estimates for the election.
“Equally approved is the payment of 2017 accommodation and furniture allowances for new members and also 2016/2017 accommodation allowances to the newly appointed commissioners,” he said.
The commissioner said that the council also approved the payment of annual retaining fee of N20 million to Dr Femi Falana (SAN) for his legal services to the state government.
Udeuhele said that Falana was engaged to handle complex litigations involving the state government.
“Equally approved by the council is the release of N20 million to facilitate the re-accreditation of School of Basic Midwifery, Awgu.”
The commissioner said that the school, one of the oldest in the country lost its accreditation over 11 years ago, adding that frantic efforts had been made to regain the accreditation.
Udeuhele assured that the training of health workers in the school would soon commence. (NAN)
