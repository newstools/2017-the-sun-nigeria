More than a hundred people rallied in central Kiev on Thursday, demanding answers in the murder of journalist Pavel Sheremet, who was killed in 2016 by a car bomb on his way to work. “A year later and we have received no more information than a day after the murder,’’ Ukrainian parliament member and former journalist Mustafa Nayyem told newsmen. Demonstrators wore T-shirts and held up banners with the question “Who killed Pavel?” as they rallied in front of President Petro Poroshenko’s office and the Interior Ministry. Sheremet, 44, was executive director of the Ukrayinska Pravda newspaper and hosted a show on Radio Vesti. He had been living in Ukraine for about five years. The bomb, with a power equivalent to 400 to 600 grammes of TNT, exploded outside a McDonald’s restaurant around 7:30 am. Sheremet had previously been a television presenter in his native Belarus, but a conflict with the ruling regime saw him receive a suspended sentence and he fled the country. (NAN)
