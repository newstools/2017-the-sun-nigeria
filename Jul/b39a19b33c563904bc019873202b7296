The prospects of Russian-US cooperation against terrorism are growing less likely with the latest passage of sanctions by US lawmakers, a senior Russian senator said Wednesday. Frants Klintsevich, the first deputy chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Defence and Security, told reporters “it makes no sense now to say exactly what our response to the passage of new sanctions against Russia will be.” “One thing is clear: if this law enters into force, and the US president should understand this, Russian-US cooperation in resolving major international problems, including countering international terrorism, will be extremely difficult, if at all possible,” Klintsevich said. The US House of Representatives approved by a 419 to three vote on Tuesday a new version of a bill that would impose sweeping sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea, and limit President Donald Trump’s ability to lift the restrictions on Moscow. The measures target Russia’s defenve, intelligence, mining, shipping and railway industries, and restrict dealings with Russian banks and energy companies. “Unfortunately, I must state that the world could enter a new ‘Cold War’,” Klintsevich said.
