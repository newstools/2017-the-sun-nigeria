A businessman has stuck more than 4,600 toy cars onto his luxury car, which draws the stares of onlookers wherever and whenever he drives it. Datuk Seri Mahadi Badrul Zaman, 34, said he has been collecting toy cars since he was a child, and decided to use them to decorate the Jaguar, instead of leaving them scattered all over his house. “I like creative ideas, and this Jaguar is my first car and has sentimental value to me, so I decided to execute the idea on it,” he told Bernama on Thursday (July 6). His creatively-decorated car is an attention grabber, with many taking photos of and with it wherever he parks the vehicle. “So far, not many of the cars (stuck on the Jaguar) have gone missing. I will have to park at a safer spot when I drive this car,” the businessman said. He said the task of decorating the car using a special type of glue took about three weeks, which cost him about RM20,000. Mahadi said that since he started driving the car in January, he has received offers to buy the one-of-a-kind car. “I will never sell this car because this has been my dream car since I was young,” he said. Asked if he would use the idea on his other cars, Mahadi said he had no plans of doing so at the moment but he did think employing it on his blazers or suits. “The idea may sound crazy but when we are creative, we will be more positive,” he said.
