From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure THE Secretary General of the pan-Yoruba socio cultural organisation, Afenifere, Chief Seinde Arogbofa has accused the Federal Government of sponsoring groups to rubbish the report of the 2014 National Conference. Arogbofa, who was a delegate to the Conference, said the report of the confab, if implemented, would provide solutions to the problems of the country, especially insecurity. The elder statesman who spoke at a press conference to herald the launch of his book titled “Nigeria: The Path we Refused to Take”, said the upsurge in criticisms of the 2014 National Conference report showed the imprints of the Federal Government in trying to discredit the conference. Arogbofa said the book, which would be presented to the public on July 25, contains suggestions on the way out of secessionist agitations in the country. He noted that the only way out of the quagmire the nation has found itself is to restructure the country in a way that would allow for true federalism. According to him, the Federal Government encourage the states to explore mineral resources in their domain and pay royalties to the government at the centre as it is done in a federal system. He said: “Those condemning the 2014 National Conference report do not know what restructuring means. The Federal Government should take hold of the report. It may not be the best, but what it contains is enough to pave way for the development of the country.”
