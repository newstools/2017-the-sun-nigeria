By Joe Apu Nigeria’s U16 women’s team billed for the final round of the AfroBasket championship in Mozambique may well be assured of a comfortable outing as the board of the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) led by Engineer Ahmadu Musa Kida has secured sponsorship for them. The Championship taking place in Beira, Mozambique, from 3rd – 12th August, 2017 according to a release signed by the Secretary General, Chimezie Asiegbu, the U16 National Team will be sponsored to the African Tourney by the AMK Foundation. The sponsorship is coming at the behest of the NBBF President who is also the President of the AMK Foundation. Speaking in Lagos yesterday, the Vice President of the NBBF, Babs Ogunade stated that the Board members are really elated at this development which gives Nigeria and the U16 Women a big opportunity to participate in the African youth Tournament which was uncommon in the past. “Coming just a few days after the inauguration of the board, it would have been a herculean task to secure a sponsor for the team which would have led to our absence at the event.” While also giving kudos to the Engr. Kida and his Foundation, Ogunade added that this is an indication that the present NBBF President and the board places a high premium on youth development.
