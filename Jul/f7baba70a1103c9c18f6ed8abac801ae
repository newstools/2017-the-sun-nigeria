the protracted feud between two top monarchs in Ogun State seems to have come to an end due to the intervention of Ogun State Governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun who brokered peace between the Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo and the Awujale of Ijebuland, Oba Sikiru Adetona. The revered monarchs have been at loggerheads over the hierarchyÂ  of obas in Yorubaland. The first salvo was fired by Oba Gbadebo who rated the Alake as superior to the Awujale. His rating was based on the classification provided by the colonial masters based on their remuneration. Oba Adetona, however, retaliated by declaring the Alake a junior oba in Yorubaland and even in his domain in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. A recent meeting between Amosun and the two monarchs was seen as a fence mending move by the governor and all things being equal our rock city source hinted us, all is now well between the two respected monarchs.
