The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Ibrahim Idris, has warned commissioners of police to conduct themselves professionally and handle criminal cases diligently.
Addressing Deputy Inspectors-General of Police (DIGs), Assistant Inspectors-General of Police (AIGs) and police commissioners at a conference in Abuja, Idris said any act of misconduct could throw them out of the force.
“I expect the highest standard from you. Don’t let anybody buy your conscience. Hold your own. I want you to be very professional, ” the IGP charged them.
Idris, who gave the assurance that the Federal Government was ready to address the challenges facing the police, urged the personnel to change negative public perception and live up to expectations.
He charged them to be civil in relating with members of the public and respect their socio-cultural values.
Idris also ordered them to embrace the ‘Change Begins With Me’ slogan and ensure that no money was collected from members of the public for bail.
“As you are all aware, bail is free. Always sensitise officers and men in your commands on this; anyone caught on this act will be dismissed from service.
“The law, as we know, is blind. We represent the most visible arm of justice and we must use that power prudently. However, we must embrace change, as the only permanent fixture in life.”
The police boss also warned that any senior policeman found engaged in any form of corrupt practices would be punished accordingly.
He said the era of bribery and corrupt practices in the police was over, while warning that any senior officer found to be engaged in corrupt practices would face the full wrath of the law.
