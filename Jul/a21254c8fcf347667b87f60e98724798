From: Paul Osuyi, Asaba he Delta State Police Command has confirmed the arrest of one of the principal suspects in the alleged murder of a commercial motorcyclist, one Cyril in Idumuje-Ugboko, Aniocha North Local Government Area of the state. Public Relations Officer of the command, DSP Andrew Aniamaka who confirmed the arrest of one Nnamdi Ochei in connection with the alleged murder, said the suspect was whisked to the headquarters of Zone 5 in Benin where the matter is being investigated. It would recalled that mayhem had engulfed the agrarian last month in which the motorcyclist was allegedly murdered by suspected thugs. The mayhem was not unconnected with the disagreement over a large expanse of land as permanent site for a proposed sports university owned by a former member of the House of Representatives, Prince Ned Nwoko. The 33-year old suspect was reportedly picked up by the police after weeks of manhunt. His arrest reportedly ignited a protest by factional youths sympathetic to his course as they threatened to cause more havoc or maim elders suspected to support the police, if the suspect was not released. He was alleged to be among some urchins that attacked some elders of the community, including the Iyase, Chris Ogwu and secretary of the communityâ€™s land allocation committees, Kenneth Illoh for supporting Ned Nwoko in his bid to establish the university in the largely agrarian Idumuje-Ugboko. Community sources informed our correspondent that the suspect was among youths loitering around the town and disrupting or causing breach of the peace in the community. But the game appears to be up for him following his arrest and subsequent transfer to Benin where he is cooling his feet in police custody.
