Real Madrid are poised to smash the world transfer record for the sixth time in their history with the €180m (£160m) signing of Monaco’s Kylian Mbappe. Florentino Perez tried to sign the 18-year-old earlier this summer but Mbappe’s family and advisers rejected the advances because they felt it would be the wrong move at the wrong time. There were concerns that he would struggle for playing time in Real Madrid’s all-star squad, something that would be completely counter-productive for a player of his age in a World Cup year. But Real Madrid have since sold Alvaro Morata to Chelsea and sent James Rodriguez on a two-year loan to Bayern Munich and the youngster’s close circle now believe he will be able to develop in the right way with the Spanish giants. Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane has been the key man in the operation, convincing the player he will be looked after at Madrid where he will join up with his compatriot Karim Benzema as well as Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale.
