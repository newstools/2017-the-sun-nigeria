An Apapa Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court in Lagos on Thursday granted a 47-year-old man, Salam Adegbenro, N200,000 bail for allegedly obtaining N300,000 under false pretext.
The Chief Magistrate, Mr Titus Abolarinwa ordered the accused to produce two sureties in like sum as part of the bail conditions.
Abolarinwa ruled that the sureties must be gainfully employed and should show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government.
The accused, arraigned on a three-count charge of conspiracy, stealing and obtaining under false pretence, had pleaded not guilty to the charge.
Earlier, the prosecutor, Insp Tony Elibeh, told the court that the accused, who resides at Ajegunle area of Apapa in Lagos, committed the offences on June 12, around the Murtala Muhammed International Airport area of Lagos.
He alleged that Adegbenro, under false pretext of selling a building plan to one Mr Raphael David, conspired with others now at large to collect N300,000 from him and absconded thereafter.
Elibeh told the court that the accused refused to pick several calls put across to his cell phone by the complainant.
He said the complainant then reported the matter to the police, leading to the arrest of the accused in his apartment.
The prosecutor said the offences contravened the provisions of Sections 287, 314 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised).
The magistrate adjourned the case until July 19 for mention. (NAN)
