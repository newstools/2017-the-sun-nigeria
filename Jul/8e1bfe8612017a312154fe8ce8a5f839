Gombe State Governor, Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo has been urged to join the race for the 2019 presidential election so that he can replicate the developmental strides he has made in his state at the national level. The call was made in Abuja yesterday by the national executive of Democratic Youths Alliance (DYA), a coalition of democratic youths across the country at the end of their two-day meeting in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). According to a statement signed by Tersoo Yisa and Barrister Daniel Fajana on behalf of the group, their decision to zero in on Dankwambo in their search for young and brilliant northerners to support for the 2019 presidential election was based on his age, track records and performance as Gombe State governor. “Dankwambo was rated based on his outstanding achievements in road infrastructure and maintenance since he was sworn into office on May 29, 2011, which has drastically reduced the spate of accidents usually recorded on roads in the state due to their bad states. “On behalf of the national executive of DYA, we commend the service and developmental strides of Dankwambo and urge him to as a matter of urgency show interest in the 2019 presidential race so that our members nationwide can intensify ongoing efforts to mobilise for him,” the group said. They further said they were convinced of the governor’s capabilities to transform Nigeria after their quiet and secret visit to Gombe State last week. “We were particularly impressed by the governor’s milestone achievements in road infrastructure in Gombe township, Kumi township roads and Biliri township roads. Within the Gombe City metropolis alone, we noticed 87 roads including six dual carriageways have been constructed,” they added. The group noted its observations were without prejudice to other achievements of the governor in the areas of health, education, agriculture and security.
