Former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi has, again, called for constructive engagement  as panacea to the restiveness sweeping across the country. Obi said this at an interactive session with some newsmen in Lagos, yesterday. Obi traced Nigeria’s problems to what he called  “leadership failure. “What we are going through now is a cumulative result of several years of  leadership failure, poor choices at various facets of our country. Recession is only an aggravating factor.” He regretted that progressively, the youths have became misdirected as they have to take as their role models, “failed and incompetent leaders who have messed the country by foisting distorted values on the people.” The former governor said urgent steps are needed to save the country from a worse situation and called for genuine restructuring of the country” in a manner that will offer hope and sense of belonging to the people of the country.” Expressing satisfaction with Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo’s present engagement with the people, Obi urged him to go many notches higher by engaging directly with those involved in various agitations, and noted that “the people have lost confidence on those who pretend to speak for them.”
