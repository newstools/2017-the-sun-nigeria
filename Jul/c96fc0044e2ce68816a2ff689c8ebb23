Trump added that he had “strongly pressed” Putin “twice about Russian meddling in our election.” “He [Putin] vehemently denied it. I’ve already given my opinion,” he said. Putin confirmed on Saturday that the accusations claiming Russia meddled in the US election had been addressed during his conversation with Trump. The Russian president reiterated that there is no reason to believe that Russia interfered in the US electoral process. “He [Trump] asked many questions on that subject. I answered those questions as best I could. I think he took it into consideration and agreed with me, but you should really ask him how he feels about it,” Putin said. The US president said “a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives” had been negotiated, noting that it’s time “to move forward in working constructively with Russia.” On Friday, the first day of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Putin met with Donald Trump for more than two hours. After the meeting, US and Russian officials announced that a ceasefire agreement had been agreed upon for southwest Syria, to take effect on Sunday, July 9. The ceasefire applies to the Daraa, Quneitra, and As-Suwayda provinces. Trump said on Saturday that his meeting with Putin had been “tremendous.” Putin noted later that the Trump seen on television is different from the one in real life, adding that he felt relations between the two countries could at least be partially restored. “I think that if we continue building our relations like during our conversation yesterday, there are grounds to believe that we’ll be able to – at least partially – restore the level of cooperation that we need,” Putin said, addressing journalists.
