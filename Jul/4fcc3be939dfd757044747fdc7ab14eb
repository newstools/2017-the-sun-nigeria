The French government said on Thursday it would appeal against a court ruling in Google’s favour with regard to 1.1 billion euros (US$1.25 billion) in tax. “We will appeal this judgment in defence of the interests of the state,” budget minister Gerald Darmanin said in answer to a parliamentary question on Wednesday’s ruling. The Paris administrative court said Google, the main business of U.S.-based Alphabet Inc, was not liable for the tax demand, in line with a court adviser’s recommendation made in June.
