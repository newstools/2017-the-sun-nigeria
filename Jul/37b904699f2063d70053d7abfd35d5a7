From: Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa Governor Henry Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State has lamented the absence of federal projects in the state, particularly in the area of road infrastructure. He expressed displeasure with the development despite the contribution of the state to the revenue that accrues to the federation. According to him, the situation should not be so because Bayelsa, for many decades, have been contributing to the economic growth of Nigeria. Governor Dickson stated this when he received a delegation of the Senate Committee on Works, led by its Vice Chairman, Sen. Clifford Odia, paid him a courtesy visit in Government House, Yenagoa. While declaring that Bayelsa has the least kilometre of federal roads, he pointed out that, the Federal Government has utilised resources from the state and the Niger Delta to develop major capital cities in the country. Dickson bemoaned a situation whereby crude oil terminals in locations such as Brass in Bayelsa, Bonny (Rivers) and Forcados (Delta) where oil is lifted daily are not accessible by road. He therefore called on the National Assembly to spearhead the on-going efforts on restructuring the country to achieve an equity, peace, stability, justice and sustainable development.
