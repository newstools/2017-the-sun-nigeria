Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, who, on Saturday, celebrated his birthday, has corrected public belief on his age, revealing that he is 60 years old and not 58, as earlier believed. Governor Obaseki had earlier advised against publication of birthday advertisements, urging friends and well-wishers to donate to WeCare Trust, a charity organisation. His Chief Press Secretary, John Mayaki, who disclosed this, explained the governor was born on July 1, 1957. “The governor found that many people believed him to be 58 years old and while he is appreciative of the good wishes and sincere felicitations that have been accorded him, he also wants to ensure that people do not quote him at that age and thereby distorting history,” he said.
