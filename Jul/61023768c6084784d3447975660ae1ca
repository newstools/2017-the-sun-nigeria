From: Laide Raheem, Abeokuta The new Controller of Ogun State command of Nigeria Customs service, Sanni Madugu, has disclosed that within two months of his assumption, the command has generated over N1 billion into the coffers of the Federal Government. Madugu gave this disclosure at the weekend during a courtesy visit he paid to the Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo at his Ake Palace, Abeokuta. According to him, the visit became imperative in order to intimate the monarch on the command’s efforts at stemming smuggling activities through the state. The Controller, who said he served as a youth corps member 31 years ago in Ogun State, equally urged Alake to help educate his subjects on the need to pay duties on imported goods. He said: “There is no need for business men and women running away from Customs because not all  imported goods are contraband. What they need to do is paying duties after careful assessment of their goods by Customs officers. “As a father to all of us, both indigenes and non indigenes, we are here to inform you that we shall improve commerce and industry which Egbaland is known for. We shall partner with people to generate revenue for the government; we are not in Ogun state to chase people with guns. “No customs officer is going to use gun against individuals who are carrying out their legitimate businesses, all they need to do is to pay duties and there will be no hindrance to their lawful duties.” In his remarks, the Alake assured the Controller of his support adding that as a monarch, he would not interfere in the Command’s lawful duties. “I will not call you to release any vehicle or goods seized in the course of your duties, we shall support you. We shall continue to encourage our people not to run away from Customs, but come forward to pay duties on their goods and carry on their businesses,” Alake submitted.
