We were surprised to wake up this morning and see the social media awash with such obnoxious and destructive rumours. “This is being orchestrated by some retrogressive people who are bent on soiling the integrity of the chairman and the council. There has never been any illegal deductions from our salaries, while our relationship with the executive is very cordial,” he said. He said the councillors were completely loyal to the three tiers of government and the APC. “We are also dissociating ourselves from the alleged plot and  it only existed in the mischievous imaginations of the authors,” he added. Also reacting, the Chairman denied siphoning the internally generated revenue and salaries of any councillor. He added that the alleged non existent plot was sequel to the evil machinations of some unscrupulous persons.
