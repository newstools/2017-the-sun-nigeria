Kenneth Omeruo made a rare appearance for Chelsea at any level in their 1-1 draw with EFL League Two club Crawley Town in a pre-season friendly at the Checkatrade.com Stadium yesterday evening. Back home, most of the talk leading up to the game was that the former Sunshine Stars defender was going to make his debut for Chelsea, however, the Premier League champions decided to field an under-strength team made up of loanees and U23 players. Omeruo was named in the starting line-up alongside the prolific England youth-teamer Ike Ugbo, while the third player of Nigerian descent that made the squad list announced last Thursday, Fikayo Tomori, was withdrawn at the last minute. Fifteen minutes from time, Chelsea took the lead through Charlie Brown, who broke through the Crawley Town defense before firing past the goalkeeper. Kenneth Omeruo and Ike Ugbo are expected to be loaned out (or sold) by Chelsea before the close of the summer transfer window.
