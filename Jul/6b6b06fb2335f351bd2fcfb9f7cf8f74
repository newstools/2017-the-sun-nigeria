by Joe Apu The life of retired Nigerian FIFA badge referee, James Korinjoh has been turned upside down following the disappearance of his wife of over 21 years from their home in the Shibiri area of Ojo Lagos. According to Korinjoh who placed an SOS call to Sunday Sunsport, his wife Mrs. Joy Chikodi Korinjoh had left their #16 T. Jesus Street, Ojo Lagos, home on July 3 without a trace. The former MWO with the Nigerian Navy who got his FIFA badge in 1993 and retired in 2003 stated that he was away in Abuja when he was alerted on the development. “I don’t know where to run to now. I returned from Abuja where the NFF organized an elite referees’ course only to learn of this development. My only worry is that my wife has been suffering from memory loss which I noticed sometime in April. I have reported to the Police and ask Nigerians to help with information anywhere they see her.
