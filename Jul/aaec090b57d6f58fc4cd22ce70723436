The Group Managing Director or Zenith Bank, Peter Amangbo, on Saturday showered praises on the players and officials that took part in the just concluded National Women Basketball League sponsored by the bank.
Amangbo who was at the National Stadium, Surulere for the final of the competition, said he was elated with the sportsmanship spirit exhibited by the competitors.
First Bank Basketball Club of Lagos defeated First Deepwater also of Lagos, 84-53 to retain the title they won last year. Although the match started on a very keen note, it did not take much time before First Bank stamped authority on the game to completely dominate their opponents.
First Deepwater were able to win the third quarter 24-20 in an attempt to stage a comeback after trailing 45-22 at half time of the final match. The champions were clearly superior in the three other quarters in the largely one-sided final that was witnessed by almost a full capacity of spectators at the Indoor Sportshall of the stadium.
The Zenith Bank boss noted that the players have displayed so much guts and determination to excel al through the event which held between April 10 and August 29.
Amangbo said: “I commend all the players and officials because everybody is a winner. I want to assure all that Zenith Bank will continue to support sports and basketball in particular.
“Over the years, we are proud that many of the players who feature in this competition represent the country in international competitions.
