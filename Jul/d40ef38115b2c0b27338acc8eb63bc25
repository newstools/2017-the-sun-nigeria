Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is meeting Prime Minister Binali Yildirim at the presidential palace, on Wednesday, and a cabinet reshuffle could be on the cards, three sources with knowledge of the matter said. Erdogan’s office announced the unscheduled meeting earlier on Wednesday, and the three sources said a reshuffle could be in the works, declining to be identified because the information is not yet public. “There is a strong likelihood that there could be a decision on a cabinet reshuffle after the meeting,” said one of the sources, who is close to the presidency. A cabinet reshuffle has been widely expected since May, when Erdogan resumed his leadership of the ruling AK Party following an April 16 constitutional referendum giving him sweeping new powers.
