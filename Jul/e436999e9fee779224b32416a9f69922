The University of Ilorin (UNILORIN), on Wednesday, said that it was yet to release the provisional admission list and screening date for candidates that chose the institution in their JAMB forms. Deputy Director of the Corporate Affairs Department of the University, Mr. Kunle Akogun, disclosed this to journalists. He said : “The attention of the management of the University of Ilorin has been drawn to a statement currently trending on some social media platforms. “It is to the effect that the university had announced the date and procedure for the screening of candidates for admission for the 2017/2018 academic session. “The purported announcement even went as far as directing admission seekers to a phantom website on which to upload their eligibility details,’’ he said. Akogun in a statement said that the University of Ilorin was yet to commence any screening for the 2017/2018 admission. “In fact, we are yet to release the cut-off marks for this year’s admission. “The online announcement is the handiwork of scammers and 419ers who are bent on taking advantage of the anxious admission seekers to swindle them of huge sums of money,’’ he said. He advised the public to disregard what he described as “the handiwork of scammers.’’ Akogun said the public should have known from the headline of the statement that such information could not have emanated from the University of Ilorin. “We therefore warn all admission seekers and their parents/guardians to exercise some patience and wait for the official release of screening instructions by the university. “They should be wary of falling cheaply to the antics of scammers,’’ he warned.
