 From: Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa A group, the Nigerian Youths for Good Governance and Unity (NYGGU), has written a letter of appeal to the Acting President Yemi Osinbanjo and Governor Akinwunmi Ambode of  Lagos State over the role played by an unemployed pilot, Mr. Promise Ominisan, in the rescue of a 12- months- old baby from a ghastly motor accident in Lagos. According to the group, Mr. Promise Ominisan, an Ijaw from Arugbo community in Ondo state aged 30- years-old and a trained pilot from the Afrikan Union Aviation Academy in South Africa and Cloud 9 helicopter school in United State, rescued the 12- months -old baby in a motor accident which occurred Thursday, July 20, along Egbeda road in Lagos. The group, in the letter dated 25th of July, 2017 and signed by the Secretary-General,Comrade Victor Ben Eridei, noted that the good deed of Ominisan  saved the life of the child who was separated from her mother during the accident. The group urged that Ominisan’s case  should be used to encourage Nigerians to be united and be their brothers’ keeper. The rescue operation, which has gone viral on some news blogs and face book pages, showed the bandaged 12- months- old baby holding tight to Mr. Promise Ominisan who rescued his life. Eridie, a former State Assembly aspirant on the platform of Alliance for Democracy (AD) in Bayelsa State, stated that the Federal Government and the Lagos state government should reward Ominisan.
