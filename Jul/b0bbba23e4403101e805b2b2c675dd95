From: Noah Ebije, Kaduna Chairman, Northern States Governors Forum (NSGF), Alhaji Kashim Shettima, on Thursday, dispelled insinuation that the North was opposed to the much-touted restructuring of the country. Shettima, who is the governor of Borno State spoke at the northern governors meeting held in Kaduna in collaboration with Emirs and traditional rulers from the region. The NSGF Chairman was absent on the occasion, because he was out of the country to the United Kingdom, but his speech was read by governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State. He said it was erroneous for anybody to assume that north was opposed to restructuring, adding by Friday, July 28, the Forum would take a position on the issue. This was even as the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Abubakar Sa’ad III called on northerners to brace up and be self reliance in agriculture and related business to boost the development of the region. In his welcome address, governor of Kaduna State, Malam Nasir el-Rufai said all hands must be on deck to wipe out strife and division among the people. “In place of strife and division, let us create economic opportunities. I am confident that our engagements, and the applications of our best endeavours will enable us to contribute to unleash the vast potentials of our people,” el-Rufai said.
