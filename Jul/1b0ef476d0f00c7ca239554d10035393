 From: Rose Ejembi, Makurdi A former Minister of Interior, Comrade Abba Moro, has hailed yesterday’s Supreme Court judgement which ruled in favour of the Ahmed Makarfi-led Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) describing the development as a vindication for democracy. This was even as the Markarfi faction of the PDP in the state under the chairmanship of Sir John Ngbede has continued to celebrate since the news of the Supreme Court’s judgement filtered into the state. Comrade Moro who said this in a telephone chat with our newsmen stated that the judgement represented the interest of Nigerians and victory for the PDP. He commended the judiciary for proving to be the last bastion of hope for  the ordinary Nigerians stressing however that, “It is a case of PDP against PDP, so it is a no victor, no vanquish judgement.” The former minister while opining that the judgment would go in no small way in helping the party to reflect and reposition itself, urged the party to brace up and avoid pitfalls in the  future. He therefore enjoined the leadership of the party to do away with impunity and rebuild the party by upholding integrity and good governance. “We must strive to rebuild the party and move democracy forward.  We must also, avoid the pitfalls of the past especially the issue of impunity.  We must allow the will of the people to prevail.”
