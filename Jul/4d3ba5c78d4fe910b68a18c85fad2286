Jordan, on Thursday, threatened not to allow the return of Israeli diplomats to the Arab country unless an Israeli embassy security guard, who shot and killed an alleged Jordanian attacker and a bystander in Amman is put on trial. “The option of barring the return of the Israeli ambassador to Amman is probable if the Israeli murderer is not put on trial,” an official source told Hala Akhbar, a Jordanian news portal linked to the army. The shooting on Sunday sparked a diplomatic crisis between Israel and the Jordanians after Israel said the guard acted in self-defence and Jordan demanded an investigation into the incident. The guard, along with Israeli embassy staff, returned to Israel on Monday. “Israel should abide by the legal course in this criminal case,’’the unnamed official added. Jordanian newspaper al-Ghad, citing unidentified sources, said Jordan would not allow the Israeli embassy staff to return unless it gets “guarantees” that the guard will be put on trial. There was no official comment in Amman or Tel Aviv. The Israeli Foreign Ministry previously said the guard had shot the 17-year-old Jordanian worker after the teenager stabbed him with a screwdriver. Jordan said the teenager was shot by the Israeli guard following a quarrel, but it did not confirm the Israeli version of the incident. The Jordanian worker was installing furniture at the Israeli embassy compound in Amman. A second Jordanian bystander was wounded in the incident and later died. (NAN)
