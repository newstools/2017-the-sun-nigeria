The companies whose claims payment summed to the above amount included Universal Insurance Plc, Anchor Insurance Company Limited, Cornerstone Insurance Plc, Consolidated Hallmark Insurance Plc, AIICO Insurance Plc, Mutual Benefits Assurance Plc, LASACO Assurance Plc, Law Union and Rock Insurance, Wapic Insurance Plc and NICON Insurance Limited. Further analysis of the compensation shows that Universal Insurance Plc paid N110.1 million claims in 2016, a feat that was commended by industry observers.

Meanwhile Wapic Insurance Plc, said it paid out N3.8 billion claims in its 2016 financial year as part of its strategic efforts to demonstrate genuine commitment to clients’ obligations. This amount, according to the firm, was an increase of 76 per cent over the 2015 figure.
