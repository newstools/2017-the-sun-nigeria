By May Ubani and Favour Gurah The German government has donated six trained sniffer dogs and a Mercedes Benz bus to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) to boost the country’s capacity to detect concealed drugs.
Deputy Consul-General of Germany to Nigeria, Alexandra Herr, made the presentation in Lagos to the NDLEA Director of Operations and General Investigation, Mr. Olugbenga Mabo.
Herr, in her remarks, said Germany was making the presentation because it was important to have the right tools to work.
In her words: “I commend the cooperation between Germany and Nigeria in combating drug trafficking through the aid of sniffer dogs. I am eager to see positive results in the canine operations of the agency.”
Mabo thanked the German government for the support and pledged that the investment would soon lead to the dismantling of more drug trafficking syndicates in the country.
He said: “Twenty major arrests and seizures of narcotic drugs, comprising cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, ephedrine and cannabis, with a combined weight of 17,432kg, were made with the assistance of the sniffer dogs since 2009. The contribution of Germany has made a tremendous impact on the operations of the agency at the airport, seaport and land borders.”
