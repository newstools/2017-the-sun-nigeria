For Sierra Leone-born Nollywood actress cum producer, Ginnefine Kizzy Kanu, Nigerian men are the best she has ever dated without regrets. The actress,who recently relocated to Nigeria, to seek greener pastures,gushed: “I love Nigeria. In fact, I’m in love with Nigeria; the pidgin language was the first touch of the country that I fell in love with. I have been based here for the past 10 years. All my friends and ex-boyfriends are Nigerians. I haven’t dated any other men. I also plan to get married to a Nigerian.”
Asked what attracts her to Nigerian men, the curvy script interpreter said: “There are so many qualities of Nigerian men that women fall for; they are romantic, nice, respectful, and cherish their partners a lot. I also love Nigerian food; Egusi soup is my favorite. The only way I relax is by cooking and it’s always Nigerian food.” The actress, who is also an educationist and a US trained paediatric nurse, said she’s indeed blessed to host some of her colleagues, fans and parents at the first valedictory service of her school, Ecole Est Belle, located in Magado, Lagos. ‘I feel so blessed and favoured. My school is just nine months old and it’s been good so far. It’s been challenging, but we can’t complain. Our teachers are highly qualified and are professionals to the core. Our services are for everybody. Our overall vision is to make kids actually enjoy going to school. I intend taking it to the world. We want the world to know what we are doing here. We intend to expand but we want to grow this first,” she stated. On her latest movie project, Ms Kanu said she has been joggling her acting career with her school perfectly.
“I co-produced a movie with Desmond Elliot entittled, ‘Too Much’, and another one with Oge Okoye, I was in ‘Midnight Whisper’, ‘Three Wise Men’ and lots more. I find a way to balance both lives’’.
