From: Rose Ejembi, Makurdi The Cross River State Government has applauded Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State for playing a very proactive role in providing security and shelter to members of two warring communities that were displaced in that state. Deputy Governor of Cross River State, Prof. Ivara Esu, who gave the commendation recently when he led a delegation of the state on a thank-you visit to Governor Ortom at the Benue Peoples House, Makurdi described as laudable, Ortomâ€™s magnanimity in receiving victims of the clashes between Wanihem and Wanikade communities of Yala local government area who are currently taking refuge in Benue State. Prof. Esu conveyed the appreciation of Governor Ben Ayade who he said has pledged to sustain the cordial relationship between Cross River and Benue with a view to ensuring peaceful coexistence particularly in border communities of the two states. The Cross River State Deputy Governor who also lauded the recent signing of the anti-open grazing law by Governor Ortom described the move as a sure way to ending frequent attacks by herdsmen on the Benue farmers. In his response, Governor Ortom, while thanking the Cross River State Government for the visit and words of appreciation, described the gesture as encouraging. Ortom said the clashes between the two Cross River communities was unfortunate especially at a time the people were expected to embrace peace and work towards preventing further loss of lives and property as a result of herdsmen crises. While noting that no meaningful development can take place in an atmosphere of insecurity, Governor Ortom urged the affected communities to allow peace and harmony to prevail . He assured the delegation that Benue would continue to collaborate with Cross River State to provide security and foster economic growth between the two states.
