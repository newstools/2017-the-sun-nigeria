By Chidera Akalonu On loan Everton forward Henry Onyekuru has switched his surname on his Anderlecht shirt to Henry.
According to Owngoalnigeria, Onyekuru said he opted not to use his surname on the back of his number 9 shirt in Anderlecht as a tribute to his hero, who happens to be Arsenal legend Thierry Henry.
“I choose to have Henry on my back instead of Onyekuru as a tribute to Thierry Henry. I still look at videos of him. He was a great player, my idol. My dream is to be as good as him. Hopefully I can meet him as well. I am going to certainly extend my hand for a handshake.”
Onyekuru who scored 24 goals for Belgium side Eupen last season was courted by Arsenal, but the Gunners deferred plans to sign him as manager Arsene Wenger believes he needs another good spell to prove he is not a season wonder.
Everton were however willing to take him on board, but after signing him on a five year deal, he was immediately farmed out on loan to Anderlecht where he will gain further experience and playing time in the UEFA Champions League.
Onyekuru says joining Anderlecht on loan from Everton is best for his career despite the pain of missing out on a move to his dream club Arsenal.
“The loan to Anderlecht is good for my career. I know the Belgian league and I can gain experience in the Champions League,” he said.
On the decision to join Everton despite interest from his dream club Arsenal, 20 year old Onyekuru said it wasn’t an easy choice to make due to his love for the club he has supported right from his childhood days.
“It was not an easy choice, because since my childhood, I have been a fan of Arsenal. But I think I have time. I have to do it step by step. Anderlecht are a good team for a young player like me. Most importantly I can play.”
