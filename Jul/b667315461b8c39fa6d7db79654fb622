By Emma Jemegah In anticipation of the huge turn out of Karatekas for the 3rd edition of her ‘’ Training with the champions’’ international Karate course which will run from August 29 to September 1 in Lagos, the Nigerian Association of Shotokan Karate (NASK) is leaving no stones unturned to ensure a hitch free, world class Karate training for all participants at this year’s event. This year’s event will be run by Sensei Andy Sherry (9th Dan) and Sensei Frank Brennan (8th Dan), two of the world’s finest and most experienced non Japanese Karatekas. Apart from host Nigeria, Karate federations of Togo, Republic of Benin, Ghana and Cote d’ Ivoire have already confirmed participation and their arrival dates while a plethora of enquiries and interests have continued to pour in from other West African Franco phone and Anglophone stations. This event besides exposing participants to techniques, changes in technical formats of completion in the core areas of Kata (forms) and Kumite (point fighting) is timely given the recent adoption of Karate as an Olympic sport and another avenue for potential sporting glory for Nigeria. It’s NASK resolve to remain committed, inspite of the economic times, to the development of Karate in Nigeria through the provision of opportunities for exposure to first class, world class Karate training within and outside Nigeria.
