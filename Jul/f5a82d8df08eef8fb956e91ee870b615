• Congratulates PDP candidate From Wole Balogun, Ado-Ekiti Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors’ Forum, Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State, has congratulated Chief Ademola Adeleke on his victory in Saturday’s by-election in Osun West Senatorial District. In a statement in Ado-Ekiti, yesterday, by his Chief Press Secretary, Idowu Adelusi, the governor said the victory showed that Ademola’s elder brother, Senator Isiaka, whose death led to the by-election, did not die in vain. The governor noted that Isiaka would be happy wherever he is, and urged the senator-elect to see his victory as a call to service. “This victory is an invitation and a call to serve your state, Nigeria and mankind. After election, what should come next is how to bring dividends of democracy to the people. How to continue with the legacy of the Adeleke family which accounted for the love displayed by the people for you and which translated to the electoral victory. You are responsible to all your constituents without discrimination of any sort. Having been born into a family of great politicians, with your father serving as a senator in the Second Republic, your elder brother being a former governor and senator, no doubt, you must have undergone political tutelage that you should put to practise, to excel in your new calling,” he said. Fayose also commended Governor Rauf Aregbesola, for being an epitome of democracy by conceding defeat, a quality the Ekiti governor said is rare among many politicians. “If it were some politicians that we know, they will still be licking their wounds three years after being woefully beaten in an election,” he stated. The governor also lauded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for being transparent and urged that such should be the case in future elections in the country. He also commended security agencies for ensuring that there was no breakdown of law and order during the exercise.
