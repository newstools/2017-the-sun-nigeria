From: BillyGraham Abel, Yola A leading aspirants for the North-east National Vice Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Hon. Umar Sanda Sani, has said that he enjoys the backing of political leaders from the region including serving governors to resume office in acting capacity as the National Vice Chairman, North East. Umar made the remark, on Thursday, in statement made available to Daily Sun in Yola. According to him, “I call on party leaders and APC supporters to disregard Mustapha Salihu, who has been laying claim to the position. “The office of the National Vice Chairman (North-east) became vacant when the suspended Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Engr. Babachir Lawal, vacated the office  for a Federal appointment. “I will soon officially resume in acting capacity based on the support I have in my possession from my party. Mustapha Salihu is an impostor and the illegality to force Salihu on the region was single-handedly perpetrated by the party National Secretary. “I have received the backing of our leaders across the North-east, including our governors to serve in acting capacity  as National Vice Chairman representing North-east, which means I will soon resume fully to the party National Secretariat.” 1-Because i have support of the Apc party leaders, governors from my zone, also is a gross violation of Article 20 i (a) and article 25 c (ii) of the APC constitution ( as amended October 2014). In a chat with Salihu, he declined comment saying, “I will rather keep silent at this stage because I have directives from the National Secretariat of my party not to join issues with anyone  as it is not in the best interest of the party.”
