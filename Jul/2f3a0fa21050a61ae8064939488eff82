Former Nigeria international goalkeeper Andrew Aikhuomogbe has called for the return of Vincent Enyeama into the team as replacement for Carl Ikeme ahead of Nigeria’s 2018 World Cup qualifier against Cameroon in September.
Ikeme, who has been Super Eagles number one goalkeeper since taking over from Enyeama has been diagnosed with leukemia last month by Wolves club doctor and remains a doubt for the team.
Aikhuomogbe, a former goalkeeper of the senior national team said Enyeama remains the only capable net minder to replace Ikeme.
“As for me, I don’t think we have any better goalkeeper that can replace Carl Ikeme than Vincent Enyeama in the Super Eagles,” Aikhuomogbe told Soccernet.com.ng
“Besides, I was really worried when I first heard the news considering the fact that the other goalkeepers such as Ikechukwu Ezenwa, Theophilus Afelokhai, Daniel Akpeyi and Dele Alampasu don’t possess Ikeme’s quality.
“At least I have watched them in goal for the team and they don’t seem to impress me.
“There is nothing wrong if we recall Enyeama considering the fact that he’s experienced and he knows the terrain very well. I believe he will be so important for us against Cameroon if Rohr invites him.”
