From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan THE Nigerian Army will continue to do its best to keep the country safe in fulfillment of its mission to win all land battles for Nigeria. The Garrison Commander, 2 Division, Nigerian Army, Brig Gen.

He said:  “Definitely, from 1960 till now, the role or the mission of the Nigerian Army is to win all land battles for Nigeria and to keep Nigeria safe. Nigeria is still safe. We are still one country. Our borders are secured. We have had our crisis and we have been able to overcome it.” “For 2 Division, the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Maj. Gen. Chukwunedum Abraham has series of activities, which will end with medical outreach on July 6. So, the importance of the day cannot be over-emphasised. “It is about the existence of the Nigerian Army — all our past achievements and successes, all our battles and crisis in Nigeria. It’s for Nigerians to also know that Nigerian Army will continue to do its best.” He added: “Just like any celebration for any organisation, the Army Day celebration is to celebrate the existence of Nigerian Army from inception, which is actually on July 6. But it is a whole week activities, starting with Jumat service on June 30. On Sunday, we are going to have Christian interdenominational service. Next week, we will have series of activities that we have lined up, which will end on July 6.”
