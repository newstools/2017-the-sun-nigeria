Former FIFA executive committee member, Chuck Blazer, who had pleaded guilty to racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering has passed away, his lawyers said in a statement on Wednesday. Blazer, who was also a former general secretary of CONCACAF, which governs the sport in North and Central America and the Caribbean, was banned from football for life by FIFA in 2015 after he was indicted and pleaded guilty to charges including accepting bribes and kickbacks. He was found to have breached FIFA rules on loyalty, confidentiality, the duty of disclosure, conflicts of interest, offering and accepting gifts and bribery and corruption. Through a 2013 U.S. plea agreement, Blazer became a cooperating witness in the US investigation, which had engulfed FIFA and pressured the governing bodyâ€™s president, Sepp Blatter, to step down.
