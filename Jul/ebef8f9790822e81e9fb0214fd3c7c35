From Tony Osauzo and Ighomuaye Lucky, Benin The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the September 28, 2016, Edo State gubernatorial election, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, on Monday, congratulated Governor Godwin Obaseki on the Supreme Court judgment which reaffirmed his (Obaseki’s) election as the  elected governor of the state. In statement he issued in Benin-City, Ize-Iyamu said the Supreme Court has, by its judgment, brought to an end the struggle for the office of the governor of the state which began on 28 September, 2016. He said he accepted in good faith the  decision of the highest court of the  country, which affirmed Obaseki as the Governor of Edo State and therefore congratulated and assured him of his goodwill. Ize-Iyamu also used the opportunity to thank all his  supporters and party men and women for their immense support for their struggle right from the time of the election to this day that it ended at the Supreme Court, adding that  he would always appreciate and be available whenever they need his services. “Let me assure them of my acknowledgement of their various sacrifices and promise that I will always be there for them. “I thank all Edo people who have been part of our struggle all the way. In our various ways we should keep the fire burning in the quest for an Edo State of our dreams. “Finally, I thank God for His grace that gave me the opportunity to seek the office. To Him be all honour and Glory”, he said. ‎It would be recalled that the lower tribunal and the Court of Appeal had both in their judgments confirmed INEC’s  declaration of Mr. Godwin Obaseki of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as the winner of the election.
