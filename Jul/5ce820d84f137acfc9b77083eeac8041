With nine points off the top spot and seven matches to go, El-Kanemi Warriors coach Ladan Bosso is assured his team will still challenge for the NPFL trophy. The Maiduguri club are currently placed seventh on the league log with 46 points from 31 games. Despite their recent one-nil defeat to Sunshine Stars at the Dipo Dina Stadium in Ijebu-Ode, the former Abia Warriors coach believes his side are still in the title race. El-Kanemi Warriors will play hosts to Akawa United on Sunday, and Bosso is optimistic that his side will continue to push for the NPFL title as there are still many points to fight for. “Hope is not lost, we still have seven matches to go. You know the strength of El-Kanemi Warriors. If we travel well for our away games and get enough rest, we will trouble the home teams,” he told npfl.ng. “Over the years, people have believed that it is difficult to win points on the road, but if teams go all out on the attack, they can always get something away from home,” he said.
