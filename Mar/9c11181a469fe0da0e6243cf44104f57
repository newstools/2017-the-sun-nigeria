Zambia, yesterday, came back to beat Egypt 3-1 in the 2017 Under-20 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) Group A game at the National Heroes Stadium in Lusaka.
The victory sees Young Chipolopolo finish at the top of Group A with nine points, while the Young Pharaohs finish third with two points.
The opening stages of the game were very tense as the Young Pharaohs did well to contain the Young Chipolopolo, who were keen to take the lead.
But as the game progressed Egypt began pushing forward in numbers – applying pressure on the Zambian defence, which was led by Solomon Sakala.
Egypt forward Ahmed Aboelfetouh Mohamed was looking lively for the Young Pharaohs upfront as they searched for the opening goal.
The pressure paid off in the 35th minute when Karim Hassan put the ball into an open net to make it 1-0 to Egypt – silencing the Zambian fans in the process.
Zambia tried to grab an equalizing goal before the half-time break, but the Young Pharaohs stood firm at the back and the score was 1-0 to Egypt at the interval.
