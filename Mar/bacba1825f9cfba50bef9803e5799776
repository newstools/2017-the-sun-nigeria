From: JOHN ADAMS, MINNA Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State, at the weekend, turned down a traditional title conferred on him by a first class traditional ruler in the state. The Governor told the traditional ruler that he would only take traditional titles conferment after completion of his service to the people of the state as governor. Bello stated this in New Bussa in Borgu Chiefdom when the Emir of the chiefdom, Alhaji Mohammed Sani Dantoro Kintoro IV announced conferment of traditional title of “Majin Borgu” on him. It was not the first time that the governor had turned down conferment of traditional title on him by traditional rulers in the state. It could be recalled that the governor had earlier politely declined to receive similar chieftaincy title of “Sadaukin Kontagora” by the Sarkin Sudan Kontagora Alhaji Saidu Namaska, which he said was not out of disrespect to the traditional institutions He explained that as a serving governor, he was like a student looking forward to overall performance, adding that if his score card result at the end of his tenure showed that he had performed credibly well, then he would be pleased for coronation in chieftain robes. He pleaded with the royal father to put on hold all activities regarding the conferment of the traditional title until his score card was out with a pass result from the assessment of his performance by the people of the state. Governor Bello’s stance was, however, a complete departure from the past administration where the governor and top government officials scramble for traditional titles from within and outside the state. Earlier in his remark, the Emir of Borgu, Alhaji Mohammed Sani Kitoro IV said the conferment of the Majin Borgu on the governor was in recognition of his contribution to the peace and tranquility of the chiefdom. He enumerated the duties of Majin Borgu to include holding and watching over the treasure of the chiefdom.
