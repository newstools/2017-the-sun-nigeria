Says party crisis ends soon
Chairman of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Walid Jibrin, Thursday evening received the report of the Governor Seriake Dickson-led National Reconciliation Committee in Abuja. Alhaji Walid, who commended the governor for his commitment to peace in the party, promised that the report would go a long way in solving many of the knotty issues in the party. He noted that the partyâ€™s leadership would soon invite all the contending factions with a view to restoring peace to the PDP. Walid urged all members to forgive and bury all differences in the interest of the party, adding that the BoT will continue to play its fatherly role as the conscience of the party. He said the report had gone a long way to reconcile all factions in the party, promising to engage with all other organs of the party, including the Amodu Sheriff group. The BoT chair expressed hope that based on the template submitted by the committee, peace would soon return to the party. Governor Dickson had earlier intimated Alhaji Walid of the efforts of his reconciliation Committee to return calm to the party. He reiterated that the report could be adjusted by major organs of the party with a view to finding long-lasting peace in the party, explaining that the report was not cast in stone.
