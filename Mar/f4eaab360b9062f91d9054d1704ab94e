From: Gyang Bere, Jos Minister of Trade and Investment, Dr. Okechukwu Enelamah, has said the only way Nigeria could get out of recession was for citizens to step down the patronage of foreign products in the country. Dr. Okechukwu made the call, on Thursday, during the 2016 end-of-year merit award ceremony of the Industrial Training Fund (ITF), held at its Headquarters, in Jos. Ijn the words of the minister, “Recession does  not mean that we are in trouble or we are doomed. No, what it implies that we should be patronizing made-in -Nigeria products and goods, and step down on patronage of foreign goods except where necessary” Dr. Okechukwu, who was represented by the Director of Administration and Human Resources, Adamu Mohammed, challenged the Industrial Training Fund to articulate its position on providing skills acquisition and man power development to negotiate the country out of the prevailing economic recession. “I wish to reiterate the desire of the Buhari -led administration to diversifying the Nation’s economy and tackling the hydra headed monster of corruption and unemployment. “ITF has the key to negotiating Nigeria out of its prevailing economic recession. The National Industrial Skills Development Programme (NISDP) is a master stroke. So far, it as turned around the fortunes of a lot of families since it debuted in 2012.” The Director General of the Industrial Training Fund, Joseph Ari said ITF is poised towards negotiating the country out of the turbulent economic recession. He said the occasion is geared towards charting a new course in line with the new vision of the present administration to provide man power development for efficient services in the country.
