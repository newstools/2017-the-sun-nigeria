From Paul Osuyi, Asaba DELTA State Government has declared a three-day mourning in honour of late Dr. Samuel Osaigbovo Ogbemudia, who died last Friday, in Lagos, at the age of 84. The late Ogbemudia was the military governor of the old Mid-West State, and in 1983, he won election to become the civilian governor of the defunct Bendel State, out of which Edo and Delta states were created in 1991. Although Ogbemudia hailed from Edo State, his landmark achievements, particularly in the area of infrastructure, as governor of Mid-West and Bendel states are evident in modern Edo and Delta states. Director of Information, Ministry of Information, Mr. Paul Osahor, in a special announcement, said Governor Ifeanyi Okowa declared the three days of mourning, across the state, to honour dead soldier turned politician. Osahor stated that the governor “directed that flags should be flown at half-mast, in both public and private institutions, during the three-day mourning as a mark of honour for the late elder statesman.” According to Osahor, the three-day mourning, which began yesterday, will end tomorrow.
