From: Emmanuel Uzor, Abakaliki It was a gory sight at the Accident and Emergency Unit of the Federal Teaching Hospital (FETHA), Abakaliki, in Ebonyi State, as an 8-month-old baby boy was stabbed by his reportedly mentally-sick mother and brought into the ward for surgery with the knife still stuck in the boy’s abdomen. Though Daily Sun could not get full details of the incident as the suspect, who was said to be a wife of a serving police Sergeant, was said to have been taken to hospital for treatment, it was gathered that the incident happened at the police barracks, Abakaliki. It was gathered that the woman who allegedly has periodic major mental disorder pierced her baby’s stomach with kitchen knife and left the knife stuck in the baby’s stomach when somebody saw it and raised the alarm that attracted neigbours. An eyewitness and a medical practitioner at the Federal Teaching Hospital, who pleaded anonymity, said the baby was brought into the emergency ward with the knife still stuck in his stomach while he had lost so much blood. In his own reaction, one Omeri Nwachi, on his facebook page wrote: “A woman stabbed this baby, you can’t imagine that it was true and I actually snapped it myself. The baby is still alive and was being prepared for surgical procedure. Please pray for the survival of this baby”. Chief Medical Director of the Federal Teaching Hospital, Dr. Emeka Ogar, said the baby had been operated upon and the surgery was successful and expressed shock at the incident. However, the Ebonyi State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Jude Madu, said full details concerning the incident were still being awaited and disclosed that the woman was a mentally unstable wife of a serving policeman in the command. He disclosed that the baby had undergone a successful surgery and the knife had been successfully removed from his system while his mentally sick mother had been taken to psychiatric hospital for medical check.
