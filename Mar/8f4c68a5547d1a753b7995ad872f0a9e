President Muhammadu Buhari has told state governors in the country that he does not need more rest as he is concerned with the challenges facing Nigeria. The president reportedly said this on Thursday when he turned down an advice by the state governors for him to take more rest. A statement by his Shehu Garba, the president’s senior special assistant on media and publicity, said President Buhari turned down the advice of the governors at a meeting of the National Economic Council (NEC) at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The statement quoted Buhari as saying: “I will not rest until I address those issues that affect our people. One of these basic things is the issue of salaries. “It is most important that workers are able to feed their families, pay rent and school fees, then other things can follow.” He commended the governors for not considering political affiliations in their goodwill messages and prayers for him while he was away from the country. Interestingly, many Nigerians who reacted urged the president to heed the advice of the governors while others said they would continue to pray for him.
