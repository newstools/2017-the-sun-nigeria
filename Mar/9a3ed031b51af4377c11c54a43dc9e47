By George Aluo The March 23 international friendly between the Super Eagles and the Stallions of Burkina Faso is not being considered a mere friendly by the Burkinabes this much Daily Sunsports can today reveal. Burkina Faso’s FA president, Sita Sangare, revealed to Daily Sunsports in Ethiopia just before the CAF election that Stallions are coming to London with revenge in mind. Sangare, a close pal of NFF boss Amaju Pinnick said they have not forgotten how the Eagles denied them what would have been their first AFCON title in South Africa 2013 where the Eagles beat the Stallions to lift the trophy. “We are coming to London fully prepared to give your team a good fight,” Sangare said. The amiable soccer buff who was one of those that plotted Hayatou’s fall said the Stallions are still hot after winning bronze at Gabon 2017 AFCON. Meanwhile, Team coordinator of the Super Eagles, Patrick Pascal has revealed that a group of the back room staff left Nigeria yesterday to the London  camp ahead of the friendly matches due for 23rd and 27th of March. Disclosing the team’s itinerary,  Pascal said visa issuance delays meant the Super Eagles backroom staff will embark on the journey for the friendlies against Senegal and Burkina Faso in two batches. He confirmed that reserve goalkeepers Daniel Akpeyi and Ikechukwu Ezenwa will also get the visas early this week.
