From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure ONDO State Police Command has arrested no fewer than 14 people in connection with last Saturday’s cult clash in Ondo, headquarters of Ondo West Local Government Area of the state. No fewer than nine people reportedly lost their lives while several others sustained injuries in the town during the clash. The suspected cultists were allegedly working for a faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the town. It was learnt that the clash was between cult groups known as Afee Cult and Eiye confraternity, each of which lost its members during the clash. The State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. Femi Joseph, who spoke with Sunday Sun on telephone, said all the suspects would be prosecuted. Although the PPRO did not disclose the names of the suspects, he said they were arrested at various locations in the town after the incident. He said: “We have so far arrested about 14 people. We are still arresting and we will continue until we arrest all of them. We are preparing to take them to court.” Joseph hinted that men of the Command had been deployed to the town to flush out the hoodlums. He, however, debunked reports that the command lost some of its personnel to the clash, saying, “none of our officers and men died in the clash.”
