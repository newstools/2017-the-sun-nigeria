From: Cosmas Omegoh Former Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaku, has condoled with members of the Adebayo family over the death of their patriarch, Gen. Robert Adeyinka Adebayo, who died on Wednesday, March 8 . Anyaoku, in a condolence message to the Adebayos, described the former Military Governor of the defunct Western Region as an outstanding officer and a great patriot. The message read: “General Robert Adeyinka Adebayo was clearly one of Nigeria’s most accomplished military officers. He served his country with distinction as an exemplary Military Governor of Western State from 1966 to 1971. I recall with particular nostalgia my conversation with him in London on the eve of his departure to assume his new responsibilities in Ibadan. “He will long be remembered as both an outstanding officer in the Nigerian military and a great patriot who sought through his presidency of the Yoruba Council of Elders to promote harmony and nationalism among Nigeria’s ethnic groups. “My wife joins me in sending our deepest condolence to you and entire Adebayo family, and our prayer that his soul will rest in perfect peace.”
