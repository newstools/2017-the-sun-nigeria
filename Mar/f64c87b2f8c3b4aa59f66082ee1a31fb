The Philippines, on Tuesday, filed a protest against a “highly negative depiction” of its President, Rodrigo Duterte, in a US television series, the country’s embassy in Washington has said. It also urged TV network CBS to correct the portrayal in an episode of the political drama “Madam Secretary,’’ aired on Sunday. According to the embassy, a fictional character described as the “Philippines’ unconventional new president” is punched in the face by the female lead character for inappropriate behaviour. The embassy said it sent a protest letter to CBS, demanding the network urgently take “necessary corrective actions” because the programme would have “injurious effects” on the interests of the Philippines and Filipinos. “This highly negative portrayal of our head of state not only casts doubt on the respectability of the Office of the Philippine President but also denigrates the way our nation navigates foreign affairs. “It also tarnishes the Philippines’ longstanding advocacy for women’s rights and gender equality,’’ the embassy said in a statement. Duterte, who took office in June 2016, has become notorious for a string of foul-mouthed and sexist remarks, a deadly campaign against illegal drugs and threats to break ties with the country’s oldest ally, the US. The 71-year-old has already told former president Barack Obama to “go to hell” and called the UN “stupid.” The CBS was not available for comment when contacted. (NAN)
