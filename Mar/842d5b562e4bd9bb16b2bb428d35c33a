The suspended technical adviser of Lobi Stars of Makurdi, Chief Godwin Koko Uwua, has sensationally resigned his appointment with the team.
Uwua, whose suspension was for three matches, which elapsed after the 2-1 win against Enyimba last Sunday, in a statement said he decided to quit the job to preserve his professional integrity and in the interest of Lobi Stars.
In the letter addressed to the Benue State deputy governor, he made reference to his suspension for playing a draw at home with Katsina United as a calculated attempt to embarrass him, destroy his image and jeopardise his credible effort as a coach while at the same time denying him the credit for the work he started at the beginning of the season.
The coach lamented that when he drew in Port Harcourt against Rivers United, the board never gave him a commendation letter, yet at the time of his suspension, he had won three matches, drawn two and lost two.
“I thank His Excellency and his wife, the First Lady for the opportunity to once again serve the state as the technical adviser of Lobi Stars.
I have to resign before somebody is killed if they continue to play draws.”
