From: Kemi Yesufu And Ndubisi Orji, Abuja Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara, has described former governor of Lagos State and a national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as ‘a dogged and tireless fighter for democracy’. Thjis was on the occasion of Tinubu’s 65th birthday. Dogara, in a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Public Affairs, Turaki Hassan, further described Tinubu as “a leader, man of vision, and dogged fighter for democracy who has and continued to make invaluable contributions to democratic governance of Nigeria”. He likened Tinubu to the proverbial elephant whose description varies with each individual, adding that any attempt to describe him will amount to grave injustice. The statement read: “He is undoubtedly one of the leading lights of our modern democracy. I can only say this based on the part I have touched. I see him as someone who is demonstrating the attributes of a true leader. “He is not a regional leader. Some who thought he had everything cut out for him in the South-West and he may not be able to play on a more national platform, got it wrong as they saw how together with some other committed leaders in this country, how they midwived a political organization that so many pundits believed it was impossible for them to midwife, they midwived it and in the history of this country, for the first time, an opposition party which was built on some blocks including the great Asiwaju himself succeeded in wrestling power from the hands of the ruling party”, the Speaker noted. Dogara, prayed for the APC leader to age gracefully and in good health, in order for, “some of us who have come to see him as a mentor will continue to learn more and drink from the fountain of his wisdom.”
