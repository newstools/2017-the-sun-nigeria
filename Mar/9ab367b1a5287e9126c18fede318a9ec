From: Ali Abare, Gombe A lawmaker in Gombe State, Mr. Rambi Ayala, has donated N1 million for the construction of a health facility in his constituency. Ayala represents Billiri East Constituency in the state’s House of Assembly. The lawmaker made this known while presenting N1 million cheque to village head of Kufai community, Mr. Dedan Kamaso, on Sunday. Ayala explained that the donation was to help the community pay the mandatory 10 percent of the N10 million bid for the project at the Gombe Agency for Community Development, a world bank assisted project. According to him, “In each project that a community bids for, they are expected to contribute 10 percent of the total amount that would be spent. The Agency will take care of the 90 percent. “A non-governmental organisation (NGO), Hope Spring International, which I have been partnering with, provided the 10 percent for Kufai community,” he explained. While commending the people of Kufai community for their enthusiasm, the lawmaker promised to follow up on the project to ensure its completion. He urged other communities to emulate the Kufai people. While receiving the cheque, Kumaso noted that the lawmaker’s visit was the first official constituency visit to the community by any legislator, adding that the decision to construct a health facility is informed by the absence of health care facility in the community. “Our women have to go to the General Hospital Billiri, whenever the need arises or there is an emergency,’’ he lamented.
