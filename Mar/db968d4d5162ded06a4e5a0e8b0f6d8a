North Korea’s Ambassador to Malaysia, Kang Chol, left the country, on Monday, less than 48 hours after the government in Kuala Lumpur declared him persona non grata. The diplomat’s departure came exactly three weeks after the February 13 killing of Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at Kuala Lumpur’s international airport. Kang had spoken out against the Malaysian authorities even accusing the government at one point of colluding with foreign powers during the investigation into the alleged murder. Kang also said the probe could not be trusted and had tried to point the finger of blame toward South Korea. Much speculation into Kim’s death has focused on whether the death was the result of a conspiracy launched in Pyongyang. Kim was allegedly attacked by two women who swabbed a toxic chemical VX nerve agent on his face. Malaysia’s Foreign Ministry on Saturday released a statement ordering Kang to leave the country by 6pm Monday (1000 GMT). “Malaysia will react strongly against any insults made against it or any attempt to tarnish its reputation,’’ Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Haji Aman had said in the statement.
