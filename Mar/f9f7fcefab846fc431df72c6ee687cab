ARSENE Wenger revealed he will make an announcement about his Arsenal fu- ture “very soon” after his side’s prob- lems increased in a 3-1 defeat at West Bromwich Albion yesterday. “I know what I’ll do in my future, so you will know very soon,” Wenger told reporters after Arsenal’s fourth loss in five Premier League games. Wenger, Arsenal’s manager since 1996, is under heavy pressure after his side were thrashed 10-2 on aggregate by Bayern Munich in the Champions League and fell five points off the top four in the Premier League. On the other hand, Gary Cahill’s 87th-minute winner earned runaway leaders Chelsea a 2-1 victory at Stoke City, while champions Leicester City’s resurgence continued with a 3-2 victory at West Ham United. Craig Dawson scored two headers at The Hawthorns as West Brom con- demned Arsenal to a sixth defeat in nine games in all competitions. “We lose game after game at the mo- ment and that for me is much more im- portant than my future.”
