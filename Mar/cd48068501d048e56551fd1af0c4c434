FROM: PAUL ORUDE, BAUCHI The Emir of Bauchi, Alhaji (Dr.) Rilwanu Sulaimanu Adamu, has directed the immediate and permanent suspension of his second in command, and the Waziri of Bauchi, Alhaji Mohammadu Bello Kirfi from the Bauchi Emirate Council. A press release dated March 6, made available to Daily Sun, stated that the Emir suspended the Waziri, a former minister of Special Duties in the Presidency during the Olusegun Obasanjo administration, due to “unsatisfactory conduct and disloyalty to the Bauchi Emirate” The release did not specifically mention the nature of the “unsatisfactory conduct” that led to the suspension of the Waziri. The Waziri is one of the kingmakers in the emirate. A source close to the palace said the reason may not be unconnected with what transpired between the Emir and the Waziri at last Friday’s Juma’at prayer at the central mosque. Our source, who pleaded anonymity said: “When the Waziri came into the mosque, he saw Alhaji Adamu Aliyu (The Walin  Katagum), former Nigeria Ambassador to Japan, sitting close to the Emir which was supposedly his position. “The Waziri felt it was not right and promptly reprimanded the Wali and as the Wali made to change his position, the Emir of Bauchi held his hand and asked him to remain seated. “The action of the Emir, according to our source, led the Waziri to rebuke the Emir openly, telling him that he is not the rightful person to occupy the position, saying the Emir’s action was tantamount to bringing disrespect to the Bauchi emirate council.” Our source further hinted that the Emir was furious with the public outburst of the Waziri and directed his immediate and permanent suspension to assert his authority. All attempt to reach the Waziri failed but it was learnt that his family members have advised the Waziri to remain quiet over the issues and see it as his destiny.
