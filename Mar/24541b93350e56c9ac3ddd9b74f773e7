The management of Rivers United of Port-Harcourt has slammed a match ban on its Technical manager, Coach Stanley Eguma. According to a press release made available to Daily Sunsports, the suspension came as a result of a decision reached by the management of the team following the lateness of the coach to an NPFL game. Coach Eguma was said to have arrived the match venue eighteen (18) minutes after kickoff in yesterday’s NPFL game between Rivers United and Plateau United. Following this development, Eguma will not be part of the Rivers United team for this weekend’s NPFL game against Gombe United in Gombe. Efforts to reach the embattled coach last night proved futile as he failed to pick calls put across to him.
