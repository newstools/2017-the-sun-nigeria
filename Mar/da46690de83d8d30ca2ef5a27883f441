Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Nasarawa State chapter, Bishop Joseph Masin has debunked claims that Muslims were marginalising Christians in the state. The CAN chairman said in an interview with newsmen, in Lafia, on Thursday, that those making the claim were merely being mischievous. He described Muslims in the state as peace loving, accommodating and united, adding that there was no cogent reason to back up such marginalisation claim especially with regards to political positions in the state. “When Christians say they are marginalized, who are the real cause of the marginalization? Christians are the cause of the problem not Muslims. “When you don’t stand together, when you are not united, how can one of us get to be governor,” he queried. He advised Christians in the state to stop bickering, stand together and unite as a family. “If Christians remain scattered, they will still continue losing it and any other position they aspire for. “So it is not the problem of the Muslims marginalizing them, they are the ones marginalising themselves by scattering, they are the cause,” he added. Masin explained that CAN would continue to preach for unity in the state, to promote understanding and cooperation. The CAN chairman also spoke on the indifference of most Christians in the state to the issue of pilgrimage to Jerusalem. “We have noticed that many Christians don’t show interest in the holy pilgrimage. “So now we are trying to educate them and make them understand that pilgrimage is very important and why they should visit Jerusalem,” He said.
