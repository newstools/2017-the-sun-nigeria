From: Tunde Omolehin, Sokoto Nigerians have been urged to continue in their prayers for the full and total recovery of President Muhammadu Buhari. Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State made the appeal, in Sokoto, on Tuesday, when the Forum of Directors of Social Communication of the Catholic Church paid him a visit in Sokoto. The members were led by the Bishop of Sokoto Diocese of the Catholic Church, Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah. Tambuwal said the President would remain grateful for all the prayers offered by Nigerians at the moment. His words: “The nation will remain grateful for the fervent prayers you have embarked upon while the President was away receiving medical attention. “Along with our Muslim brothers, we all prayed and it is gratifying to note that our prayers have been answered. We should not relent on that,” he said. Tambuwal, however, urged them to deploy their knowledge and experiences to promote religious harmony and peaceful coexistence in the country. He said Sokoto has a history of religious tolerance, and has been open to diverse ethnic and religious groups since the time of reformist scholar, Usman Danfodio. He continued, “We believe the whole country can learn from our rich history of tolerance and moderation. I’m happy you have chosen Sokoto for your meeting. “From what you have seen yourselves, you can take the positive message of peace to your dioceses and your homes,” the Governor added. In their separate remarks, both Fr. Kukah and President of the Diocesan/Religious Directors of Communications, Fr. Pius Ukoh, said they were in Sokoto for their bi-annual retreat, and commended the Sokoto government and the Sultanate Council for their commitment to peaceful coexistence in the state.
