The Federal Inland Revenue Service [FIRS] on Thursday began a sensitisation programme to enlighten tax evaders to embrace the tax net for national growth. A Senior Manager, FIRS, Mr. Chinedu Adirije, told the News Agency of Nigeria in Kaduna that the programme was to sensitise Nigerians to their obligation relating to tax payment. Adirije said that the FIRS was also focusing on educating young Nigerians on the culture of tax payment and what government did with the tax money generated. “We find out that many people that know about tax don’t even know what to do and where to pay their tax,’’ he said. The News Agency of Nigeria reported that the programme was held at the ongoing 38th Kaduna International Trade Fair. He said it was important to get the over 70 per cent of Nigerians not paying tax to do so as part of their civic duties. “I can’t really blame them because some of them don’t even know that they are supposed to pay tax and that is the job of the FIRS to engage and enlighten them. “It is important for people to know that as long as you earn an income, whether there is recession or not, you have to pay tax,’’ Adirije said. He added that as part of the campaign, people were assisted to generate Tax Identification Number on the spot, without going to any of the FIRS offices. Adirije said the Federal Government was also creating an enabling environment to encourage people to pay tax, including collaboration with banks to issue loans to individuals and businesses.
