From Rose Ejembi, Makurdi. Tragedy struck last Saturday after a prison inmate was killed by Fulani herdsmen at Mini Prison farm center located along Jato Aka – Kashimbila road in Benue state. Our correspondent gathered that the prisoner, Tersoo Agidi who was serving his jail term at the Mini prison had gone to fetch water together with some inmates at Mkomon tributary of River Katsina Ala when suddenly, the herdsmen fired a shot at them which hit him in the head and he died instantly. Terso’s remains had been deposited at NKST Hospital Jato Aka mortuary, while the Prison Authorities were said to have evacuated all inmates at the prison to other facilities. The Public Relations Officer, Benue Prisons Service, ASP Stephen Nwanchor who confirmed the report disclosed that herdsmen invaded its Jato-Aka Farm Centre and killed an inmate but dispelled rumors that it was an incidence of an attempted jail break. “This is a new farm centre established in January, 2017. The herdsmen invaded the place, destroyed property, shot and killed one Tersoo Agidi, an inmate. We have evacuated all the remaining inmates from the farm centre to Gboko, pending the outcome of the investigation.” Also, the state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Moses Yamu who confirmed the report said the act was perpetrated by herdsmen stressing that investigation into the killing had commenced.
