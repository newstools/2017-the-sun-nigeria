From: Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, has expressed dissatisfaction with the condition of vehicles belonging to the state government. The Governor, who inspected the state government secretariat and the vehicles parked in the car pool, said the vehicles were not well taken care of by their users. Most of the vehicles inspected by Akeredolu were those used by political appointees in the immediate past administration of former Governor Olusegun Mimiko. The governor said he was surprised to see many cars that have been parked for several years rotten away without any maintenance. He stressed the need for government to look inward to make provision for its needs due to the current economic recession in the country. Akeredolu informed that an audit shall be carried out to ascertain the exact number of the vehicles and their condition, declaring that his administration will not allow wastages of government resources and properties. The Governor, who promised to be prudent with the state resources, assured that public funds will be judiciously spent for the development of the state. He therefore warned civil servants against sabotage and acts that may undermine his government, stressing that his administration will be anchored on honesty, integrity and service.
