By Christopher Oji It is still pains, sorrow, mixed feelings and admission of the reality of the death by suicide of Dr. Allwell Oji who Sunday night plunged into the Lagos lagoon from the Third Mainland Bridge. But for his mother who lives in Abule Ijesha, a suburb of Lagos, there is no reality in the report of her son’s death. However, the Lagos Police Command and other rescue workers had not found his body in the lagoon but said they were still scurrying the waters and hoping that before daybreak Tuesday the body would have been fished out of the water for proper identification and a conclusive statement by the police. As Daily Sun reporter called at Oji’s mother’s residence, the woman still refused the news or veracity of her son’s death and vowed she still expects him alive because “he it is not true my son died.” Also there to give support to her stance are prayer bands that have occupied the home of the ‘bereaved’ mother still praying and seeking divine intervention that the rumour of Oji’s death rather remains a rumour for all times without any seed thereto. At the hospital where Oji worked until his demise on Sunday, his colleagues still find it also difficult to believe Oji plunged into fatality. They said the ‘late’ doctor was never introverted, but the type that speaks freely with people and not given to swallowing his pains without voicing out. They still cant understand how he bore whatever burden that led him to cutting short his life the way he did that fateful day. Until his death, we found that Oji who lived in Surulere was still single.
