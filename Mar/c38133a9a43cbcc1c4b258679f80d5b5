The Benue State Government, on Thursday, announced the reintroduction of the annual Grassroots School Games for sports development in the state. Director of Benue Sports Council, Mr. Philip Nongo said in Makurdi that the games would hold in the third quarter of the year. He said the games would help to discover young talents that would represent the state and the country in various sporting competitions. He added that “we are going to discover hidden talents at the local government level; sporting activities have been abandoned in the grassroots for long and it has caused us a lot.” The director said it was important to engage youths in sports for physical and mental fitness. Nongo, who described sports as an instrument for peace, said “it unites people, irrespective of where they come from. “Sport is very important to the development of nations, No serious government will pay less attention to it.” He, however, appealed to corporate organisations and individuals to sponsor sporting activities for both national and international tournaments.
