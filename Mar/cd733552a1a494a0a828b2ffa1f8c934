An indigenous group, Ikale Strategic Movement (ISM), has called on the People’s Democratic Party’s Gubernatorial Candidate, Eyitayo Jegede SAN and the leadership of PDP to pick an Ikale Indigene in person of Otunba Bamidele Akingboye as Deputy Governor. The group comprising people of Ikale origin home and abroad declared in a communiqué at a meeting in Okitipupa on Saturday, 15th August, 2020, after extensive deliberations on the Political future of the Ikale people ahead of the 2020 gubernatorial election. In the resolution signed by the group’s National Coordinator and Secretary, Comrade Segun Akinsuroju and Engr. Dayo Alade respectively, the non-for-profit group alleged PDP leaders of a plot to completely scheme Ikales out in the ongoing political game despite the huge contributions and support of the Ikales to the PDP. They said “our people have been voting massively and remained loyal to the PDP against all odds since the era of our deceased leader, Dr Olusegun Agagu.
“We vote massively for the PDP in subsequent elections since 1999 and will not be pleased if our only reward would be to be completely shut out” The group noted that if the PDP refuses to consider their request, they may not be able to guarantee the support of their members in Okitipupa and Irele LGAs. “It would be difficult to convince our people to continue to vote for PDP, especially in the forthcoming Gubernatorial Election. As it is now clear that other political parties have labeled us to be unrepentant PDP loyalists, and therefore abandoned us to our fate in power sharing formula ” They said. Furthermore, they urged the party to go back to records and check the performance of the party in Okitipupa and Irele LGAs since 1999 to verify their claims and be considerate in choosing Eyitayo’s running mate.
