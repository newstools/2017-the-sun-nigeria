By Tony John, Port Harcourt President Muhammadu Buhari has told governing councils and management of Nigerian universities to restrict their operations to laws that established the schools and warned against frequent conflicts between them.
Buhari gave the warning yesterday, at the 31st convocation ceremony of the University of Port Harcourt, Rivers State, saying that the Federal Government would no longer tolerate incessant and unnecessary flexing of muscles between the two parties.
The President, who is the Visitor to the university, advised that governing councils of universities, should not be involved in the daily activities of the institutions.
Speaking through the Minister of State for Education, Professor Anthony Onwuka, Buhari advised university authorities to weed out students who score below the acceptable points from the campuses to avoid them constituting nuisance in the school environment.
He stressed that students who have no business being on campus with their unacceptable poor results, should be shown the way out, to prevent loitering around campuses and forestall problems.
Earlier, the Vice Chancellor of the university, Professor Ndowa Lale, disclosed that a total of 5,366 postgraduate diplomas, masters and doctoral degrees were conferred on deserving students at the convocation ceremony.
According to him, the institution had earlier awarded lower degrees to 14,715 graduands  on Friday, at a similar convocation programme specially designed for them.
Speaking further, the Vice Chancellor commended President Buhari for the commitment  he had demonstrated to the development of university education in the country.
“Mr President’s vision for better university system is evident everywhere and even his most implacable critics grudgingly admit that great things are happening in the universities under his watch,” he said.
