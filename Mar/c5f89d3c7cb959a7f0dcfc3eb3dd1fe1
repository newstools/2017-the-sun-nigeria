Governor Kashim Shettima of Borno State, on Thursday, inaugurated new caretaker committees to run the affairs of the 27 Local Government Areas in the state. The caretaker committees were inaugurated in Maiduguri after the expiration of the six months tenure of the previous committees. The governor said that the inauguration was in accordance with the provision of Section 81 of the Borno State Local Government Law 2000 as amended. Shettima warned the new caretaker chairmen against having any links with Boko Haram insurgents. “In the last few months we have had cases of chairmen, vice chairmen being arrested by the military for security concerns. “Let me say that any caretaker chairman who dares to bring shame on this administration will be on his own,” Shettima said. He directed all the caretaker committee chairmen to relocate to their councils of appointment, threatened to sack those who refused to comply. (NAN)
