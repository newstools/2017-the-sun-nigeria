From: Tunde Omolehin, Sokoto Member, representing Yagba East State Constituency in the Kogi State House of Assembly, Hon. (Alh.) Musa Jimoh Omiata, has shed more light over his defection from Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He explained that his decision was geared toward consolidating Governor Yahaya Bello’s progressing achievements in the state. Omiata noted this in a statement made available to Journalists on Wednesday, and titled: “My Defection to APC: A hard decision to take, but predicated on actualising sustainable development for Yagba-East Constituency.” The lawmaker was one of the six members of the Assembly who recently defected to All Progressive Party (APC), the ruling party in the state. He reasoned that teaming up with Governor Bello’s New Direction Agenda, his constituents  will benefit immensely, especially in the areas of infrastructural facilities which according to him “a non- existent in the constituency.” His words: “I decided to team up with the mainstream Governance of His Excellency, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, with a view to facilitating development projects to our people and coupled with the reality that ongoing projects are been executed in Yagba East by the State Government. “Personally, I have no grudges with the PDP party faithful and supporters, but I considered the overall interest of our people well and above selfish gains, which culminated into my defection to APC. “Logically, I came to the realisation that I cannot be outside and know what is going on within. I am positive that my teaming up with the New Direction Agenda of this Administration, our people will benefit immensely, in terms of infrastructural facilities which are non-existent in our Constituency. He however urged supports from both his former new party members and promised to carry them along on the aims and objectives of Yagba East Development.
