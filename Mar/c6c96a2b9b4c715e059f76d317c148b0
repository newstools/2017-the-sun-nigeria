France and Indonesia, on Wednesday, agreed to make every effort to pursue peace between Palestinians and Israel, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said. French President Francois conducted talks with Joko in Jakarta, the first official visit to Indonesia by a French president in 30 years. Joko said: “we discussed the issue of Palestinian independence and the fight against extremism and terrorism,” Joko said after the meeting at the presidential palace. “We agreed to continue efforts to achieve peace between Palestine and Israel through the two-state solution concept.” Joko said it was important to promote tolerance and fight xenophobia to defeat extremism.
