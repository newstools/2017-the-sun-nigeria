Former President Goodluck Jonathan has debunked reports which included him as one of  prominent Nigerians, who had been linked to certificate scandal.
A statement issued, yesterday, by his media adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, dismissed the claim as lies and stressed that Jonathan has “never been linked to any doubt, scandal or controversy concerning his academic qualifications.”
“We really don’t know where this is coming from, but we wish to remain unambiguous in our assertion that this is obvious falsehood, since the former President has never been linked to any doubt, scandal or controversy regarding his academic qualifications.
“We are not aware of any probe, allegation or litigation relating to his academic qualifications. For the avoidance of doubt, we wish to restate that former President Jonathan’s educational
records can easily be traced to St Michael’s Primary School, Oloibiri and Mater Dei High School, lmiringi, where he obtained his First School Leaving Certificate (FSLC) and General Certificate of Education (GCE) Ordinary Level, respectively, as well as the University of Port Harcourt, where he received his Bachelor of Science, Master’s and Doctorate certificates. Luckily, many of former President Jonathan’s classmates from primary school through the university are still alive and are traceable,” the statement read.
