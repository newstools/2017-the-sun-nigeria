From Olanrewaju Lawal, Birnin-Kebbi Over 40 communities in Kebbi Sate are in danger as Kainji and Jebba dams have started releasing excess water, due to the frequent rainfall. Kebbi State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) made this known, yesterday. The affected areas, said SEMA, include Bagudo, Ngaski, Shanga and Yauri local government areas, due to proximity to the River Niger. SEMA Acting Executive Secretary, Alhaji Abass Rabiu Kamba  who stated this in Birnin-Kebbi, told newsmen  “the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) just alerted us that Jebba and Kainji have started releasing water from their dams and  its likely to affect nine states, including Kebbi. “They have asked us to give them names of the local governments that might be affected. I think they want to estimate the population of the communities and we have already submitted the data to NEMA. “We also gave them names of the communities where camps would be sited in case of any displacement of people by the flood,” he said. Kamba added  that SEMA has started  enlightenment campaign to alert various communities on the danger the overflow might cause while measures are being taken to curtail it.
