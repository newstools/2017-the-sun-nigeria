From Wole Balogun, Ado-Ekiti Former envoy to Canada and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship aspirant in Ekiti State, Ambassador Dare Bejide, has boasted that the outcome of the primary for the 2018 governorship election will shock Governor Ayodele Fayose. He maintained that Fayose’s endorsement of his deputy, Prof.  Kolapo Olusola, as the sole candidate will not stand, as it was a nullity and exercise in futility. Pro-Fayose PDP stakeholders had, last week, endorsed Olusola, when they described him as the most outstanding to fly the party’s flag, among contenders for the seat. Addressing his supporters in Ado Ekiti, yesterday, Bejide said he remains a major contenders in the Ekiti 2018 governorship election, and vowed to clinch the PDP ticket, in spite of Olusola’s endorsement by the governor. The PDP chieftain said he is neither rattled not disturbed by Fayose’s conduct since the party’s constitution is unambiguous on how a primary should be conducted. He also said the constitutional infraction leading to Olusola’s imposition won’t stand. He said: “I have since met with our party leaders pointing them to some possible effects of the illegality committed by the self-acclaimed stakeholders. “Firstly, such action negates the constitution of our party and thus misrepresents the PDP Ideology.” On whether he would be participating in the party’s primaries slated for March, 2017, Bejide said: “Check your records, I am the most consistent and outstanding personality among the contestants in Ekiti today, because, I am experienced. “I joined other leaders, few of who are still politically active, to build the PDP, after I served as pioneer secretary of the party in Ekiti state, in 1998.” You may wish to ask others if they are unaware of that. “I made bold to say that, in the forthcoming primaries, the result will shock many people because I will convincingly defeat Fayose, his boy and cronies,” he boasted.
