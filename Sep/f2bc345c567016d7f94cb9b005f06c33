The former National Chairman of All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA,  Chief Victor Umeh, has drummed up support for the second term bid of Governor Willie Obiano. He said that with the zoning formula adopted by all the major parties in the coming gubernatorial election in the state, Obiano’s chances of reclaiming his seat had become even brighter.Umeh, who is also the Chairman of Governor Willie Obiano Re-election Campaign Organisation, expressed contentment with the political maturity demonstrated by the unanimous adoption of the zoning formula and expressed optimism that Obiano, who is standing election on the APGA platform would win fair and square. The former national chairman of the party,  who spoke at Governor Obiano’s Campaign Secretariat, in Awka commended the leadership of the state chapter of Ohanaeze Ndigbo and the State Elders Advisory Council for maintaining their position that Anambra North should be allowed to complete its eight-year term before the gubernatorial position goes to Anambra South. Chief Umeh declared that Anambra was firmly in the hands of APGA and that there was nothing to fear in the candidates paraded by other political parties running for election. “Governor Obiano has done well and there is no reason he should not get his second term in office,” Umeh observed, adding that it would make perfect sense and ensure equity for all zones if Obiano were allowed his second term in office. According to him, if any of the other aspirants were to emerge a winner in the November 18 election, it might create a problem, as the winner would naturally want to serve two terms, which would delay the chances of the South getting another shot at leadership. Also speaking on the coming election, the Deputy Governor of Anambra State, Dr. Nkem Okeke, described APGA as the party of choice for Ndi Anambra and urged the people to turn out in their numbers to vote for the party. Addressing APGA faithful in Onitsha North Local Government Area recently, Okeke urged the people to close ranks and vote for continuity in the coming election. On the need for  Obiano to be returned to the Government house, Okeke said this was necessary, following the governor’s proof of competence in the governance of the state. He also buttressed his point by noting that Anambra Central has served two tenures at the Government House and since Obiano hails from Anambra North, he should be allowed to equally enjoy two terms after which the South would be given the chance to enjoy its own two terms for the sake of equity. He cautioned voters to beware of money bag politicians, who would stop at nothing to ensure that they get into the Government House only for their selfish interest. In his response, the APGA Chairman, Onitsha North Local Government Area, Mr. Martin Obika, assured that party members would do their best to ensure a landslide victory for Governor Obiano at the polls. function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
