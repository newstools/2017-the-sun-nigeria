Goldberg’s empowerment initiative dubbed ‘Isedowo’, which was launched last month by the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja II, will move its train to Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State today Friday, September 22. The second edition in Ado Ekiti will also reward artisans with excellent entrepreneurial ideas with a grant of N300,000 to support their businesses. Goldberg, from the stables of Nigerian Breweries Plc, would, through the scheme, extend its affinity with the people of the Southwest beyond culture and tradition to entrepreneurship. Commenting on the initiative, Portfolio Manager, Mainstream Lager and Stout brands, Nigerian Breweries Plc, Emmanuel Agu, said through the empowerment platform, Goldberg would have positioned itself as an empowerment platform that shares the aspirations of the people. At the launch of the initiative, the Ooni of Ife expressed his appreciation for the youth emancipation initiative and commended Nigerian Breweries for taking a bold step at improving the lot of small-scale entrepreneurs in the Southwest region. The traditional ruler further called on all Yoruba youths who are skilled in trade to grab the opportunity to showcase their business potentials and be rewarded.
