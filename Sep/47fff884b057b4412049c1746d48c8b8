From Obinna Odogwu, Abakaliki Mrs Ukamaka Nkwegu, who was recently delivered of triplets at Maternal and Child Health Clinic, Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital has sent a ‘Save-Our-Souls’ message to Ebonyi State Government and good-spirited individuals to enable her take care of the new-borns, after her husband abandoned them.
It was gathered that Nkwegu, who, until she was abandoned, was the third wife of her husband, was brought to the hospital from her village, Ozibo Obegu Ibenta, Ebonyi Local Government Area of the state, after prolonged labour.
Matron of the health centre, Mrs. Elizabeth Odoh, said Ukamaka, who is in her late 20s, was abandoned at the mercy of the maternity staff and some people who have been taking care of the babies.
“Last Tuesday, a good Samaritan took her from a park where the woman was kept and was in labour, for hours, at the park. They abandoned and accused her of witchcraft, that doesn’t want her to deliver her baby.
“A pastor’s wife took the woman to her church and they started praying. At a point, it was like the woman will not deliver safely. That was when they brought her to this hospital. When I asked the woman, she said she had her first pregnancy as twin, the third pregnancy was a single baby. With my experience, I discovered it was multiple pregnancy and I delivered one. About 10 minutes later, the second one came out. Fifteen minutes later, the third one came out.
“Since that day, till now, people have been coming here. While I decided to make it a public affair is that since that Tuesday, I have not seen the husband of this woman or his representative. He has not called on phone to know how his wife and babies are doing.”
