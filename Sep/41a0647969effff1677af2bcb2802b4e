The Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC), Kano State Command, said it had arrested 30 suspected hoodlums in Yankatsari village, Dawakin Kudu Local Government Area.
The command’s Public Relations Officer, Mr Ibrahim Idris, disclosed this while parading the suspects before newsmen in Kano on Saturday.
He alleged that the suspects were arrested on Friday (Sallah day) while in possession of dangerous weapons such as cutlasses, swords, knives and clubs following a tip-off. “The suspects were apprehended by operatives of NSCDC at Yankatsari village carrying dangerous weapons while trying to cause trouble in the area,” he said.
He said that the suspects would be charged to court for prosecution as soon as investigation was concluded.
NAN recalls that the state command of NSCDC had deployed at least 1, 500 personnel to various flashpoints in the state to strengthen security during the Eid-El-Kabir celebration. (NAN)
