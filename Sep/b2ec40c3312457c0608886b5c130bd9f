By Zika Bobby Newly-elected President of Advertisers Association of Nigeria, Mrs. Folake Ani-Mumuney, has said the biggest reason marketing campaigns fail is the wrong application of data in planning and execution of campaigns. Ani-Mumuney, who stated this at the 2017 ADVAN Marketing Day, emphasised that data tells businesses what their customers like, what wins them businesses and what makes them lose valuable opportunities. Stressing the importance of data to businesses, she said: “Data presents an interesting conundrum for us going forward; it provides the insight to make informed decisions. And ultimately, if you do not make informed decision, marketing will not be effective and, if it is not effective, our return on investments will be challenged and questioned by our chief financial officers.” Ani-Mumuney challenged marketers to scale the skills needed to remain relevant and profitable in the new age. “Given that we are in the cyber age, where the internet operates and artificial intelligence has come to disrupt what we know as traditional marketing, big data and policies that govern what we do with big data will become more important as time goes on and that will be a key area ADVAN will focus on,” she noted.
