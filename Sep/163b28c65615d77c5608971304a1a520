From Noah Ebije, Kaduna Kaduna Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, has said over 50 per cent of teachers in the state pencilled down for re-appointment as teachers, failed primary 4 test set for them as pre-condition for re-absorption into the civil service. El-Rufai also disclosed that students who were sent on overseas study are being withdrawn for poor academic ratings. The governor expressed  surprise over what he described as “shameful performance of the students because their academic performance in secondary schools back home were  convincing enough that they would do better outside Nigeria.” Early last year, governor El-Rufai awarded scholarships to 30 female students, to study medicine at a university in Uganda. The governor disclosed this when chiefs and traditional rulers from Southern Kaduna paid him a courtesy call. The royal fathers, led by Emir of Jama’a, Alhaji Muhammadu Isah Muhammadu said they decided to visit the governor to express happiness over the recent  re-opening of tertiary institutions closed down in Southern Kaduna, since December 2016, as a result of insecurity in the area. The royal fathers, however, pledged that they would continue to support and cooperate with the governor, for peace and development in southern Kaduna and the state in general. The traditional rulers also assured the governor  of readiness to run errands for him as long as it was for the development and progress of the state. Stakeholders had commended the state government for releasing N312 million for Teacher Professional Development (TPD) in 2016. “This is a clear demonstration of the government’s effort towards improving teachers capacity for effective teaching and learning in public schools,” said El-Rufai said. Schools reopened were College of Education, Gidan Waya, Kaduna State University (KASU), Kafanchan campus and School of Nursing and Midwifery, Kafanchan.
