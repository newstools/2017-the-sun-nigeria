Stories by Bimbola Oyesola Germicide is an important cleansing substance used globally to wipe out bacteria and germs that cause infection and illness in man and animals. This product is  a very vital disinfectant used in homes, restaurants, eateries, hospitals, schools and hotels, for cleaning floors, toilets, bathrooms, kitchen counters or slabs and tiles. An entrepreneur may need not sweat going into the production of germicide as it is very easy and quite cheap to make, while the return on investment is quite good due to its high demand. An investor can generate reasonable income from germicide production right from home, once determined to learn, especially in an area where there are no job opportunities. Such investor can stand out as an employer creating jobs for others. Germicide, like disinfectant, is normally sold in form of liquids and also found in detergents and cleansers as well. Going into its production, however, entails some basic guidelines for a would-be investor to be successful. Below are the essentials: Research In any market, there is always competition so it is your duty to research all about the product, including how you want to come into the market. Registration Get your business registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). Register with a name by incorporating with the right authorities in order to make your business exceptional. Give it a corporate picture and grant it a worldwide acceptance by all merchants. Raw materials Ingredients needed for production include carbonic acid, lysol, antiseptic, white binder, izal perfume or izal booster and  water Measurement: 500ml of carbonic acid, 3 litres of water, 125ml lysol, 125ml antiseptic, 125ml white binder and 120ml izal perfume. Production procedure It is important to wear safety gadgets before commencing production. Get a big bowl and measure out 3 litres of water into it; add 500ml of carbonic acid into the bowl and stir. It’s time to add your lysol; add 125ml of lysol gently while stirring; add 125ml of antiseptic to the above mixture and stir well; add white foam binder, which you have measured out to be 125ml into the mixture and lastly, add 120ml of the izal perfume, which is also referred to as concentrate. Note: If watery, add little carbonic acid. Functions of the chemicals Carbonic acid: This is a viscous golden colour fluid, which serves as a thickening agent for the germicide. Lysol: This is a brownish coloured liquid which works to kill surface and air bacteria. Antiseptic: The antiseptic commonly used in this production is pine oil. It’s major function is to fight germs and remove odour. White binder: As the name implies, it is the one that not only gives the germicide a whitish look but also binds all other components together. Germicide perfume: This is not to be confused by real perfume. This is just what gives the popular germicide its scent. Some people also call it germicide concentrate. function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
