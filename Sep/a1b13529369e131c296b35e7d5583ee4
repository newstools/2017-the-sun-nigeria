Abiodun was alleged to have buried a coffin and some other fetish items in the piece of land used as church in Ipinsa community.
A source said: “After discovering what the pastor did on the land, the community asked him to remove the items but the pastor refused, hence the action of the youths.
“The failure of the pastor to remove the fetish items on the land prompted the people of the community to take action against him. They don’t want him to turn any part of the community to his shrine.
“The Akapinsa of Ipinsaland, Oba Omoniyi Olufunmilayo ordered that palm fronds should be placed in front of his house and the land which traditionally means the house has been sealed up and nobody in those properties until the Kabiyesi reversed the order.”
According to the source, the land and the house will remain sealed up until the pastor dig up and remove the items he buried in the land.
