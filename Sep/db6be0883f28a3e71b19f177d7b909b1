The Federal Government has been asked to speed up the revitalisation of the Ajaokuta Steel Company Ltd and Aluminium Smelting Company of Nigeria (ALSCON). The National Council on Mining and Mineral Resources Development (NCMMRD) made the appeal during a meeting in Abuja. The council also called for the revival of moribund steel plants in the country, saying this would help grow the steel sector and promote private sector participation in steel development. At the meeting organised by the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, the council also urged government to compile a nationwide inventory of miners, active mining sites, processing companies and personnel to create an “all-encompassing data bank” necessary for investment planning. It also called for synergy between the government at various levels through the mineral resources and environmental management committee to enable the country “take full advantage of its vast mineral deposits. Current effort at bringing Ajaokuta Steel Company Ltd and ALSCON should be invigorated and every effort should be made by government to revive moribund steel plants and promote private sector participation in steel development,” a communique issued at the end of the meeting read. “A private sector driven single export window policy is recommended. Modalities should be put in place at every exit point and ports in the country for quantity and quality analysis. This will monitor and record all mineral exports and ascertain appropriate royalties and certifications, including the installation of weighbridges, credible international inspection outfits and the likes.” “There should be synergy between the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development and the state governments to improve operational collaboration and enhance communication for effective execution of the roadmap for the growth and development of the mining industry.”
