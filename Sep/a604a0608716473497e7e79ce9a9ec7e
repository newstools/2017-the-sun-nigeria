Tunisia has emerged the champions of Africa,  following their victory over Nigeria in the final of the 2017 Afrobasket championship in Tunis.
The Tunisian team defeated Nigeria’s D’Tigers by 77-65 points on Saturday.
D’Tigers had reached the final in grand style, raising the hope of another good outing for Nigeria after the country’s female national team, D’Tigress, won earlier in the year in Bamako, Mali.
