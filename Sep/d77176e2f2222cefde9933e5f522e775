Niger Tornadoes will file out tomorrow at the Confluence Stadium in Lokoja where they will engage relegation threatened Shooting Stars Sports Club (3SC) of Ibadan in the last match of the 2016/2017 NPFL season. Tornadoes are 14th on the table with 51 points, while 3SC are 16th with 50 points, one point behind Abia Warriors of Umuahia. Indeed, this match is crucial to the survival of the two teams, as regards their Premiership status. 3SC are in dire need of the whole three points at stake in the encounter and are expected to come out to fight with the last drop of their blood to secure the three points. But Tornadoes head coach, Abubakar Bala, has told whoever cares to listen that his wards are not thinking about relegation, According to him, relegation is not in their dictionary as they are sure of beating the Oluyole Warriors to remain afloat. “We are quite aware of 3SC precarious situation but we will not allow them enough room to operate. “We are battle ready for the three points aimed at achieving our lofty dream of finishing among the top 10 teams. “Nobody is considering Niger Tornadoes going down on relegation we are rather concerned and determined to meeting our season’s top 10 target. “Truly, it’s a daunting task but we are confident to make it a reality with the last game against 3SC in Lokoja tomorrow. “Although things have not been the same with us following the 0-3 loss at Akwa United in Uyo. “However, I have no fear over our chance to survive the scare we found ourselves at the moment. “We just have to keep our heads straight, calm and cool in the expected tough clash against 3SC. “Our problem has been the inability to convert the several chances coming on our ways in all the matches. “Once we are able to get it right by maximising the several opportunities we will have it quite easy against 3SC.” Both sides need 100 per cent positive result in the clash to guarantee their status quo in the top-flight.
