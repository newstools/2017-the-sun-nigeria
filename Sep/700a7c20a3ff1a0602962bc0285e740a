My bag, my jewelry and my fragrances. When I talk about fashion I usually put my fragrance in it because it completes my outfits. Favourite book? My bible. It wakes me up.

When I read the bible I come back alive. Favourite leader? I think I like former President Barack Obama because of what he represents. He was not discouraged from pursuing his dream; he did what he set out to do. I love Oprah Winfrey. I like what she represents as well. She’s a very strong woman too.
