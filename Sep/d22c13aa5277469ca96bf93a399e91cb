Award winning Nigerian Singer, Tiwa Savage has called on women not to allow their gender limit them from attaining their utmost best in life.
Sawage who was reacting to her making of the BBC 100 Most Inspirational and Innovative Women list said this on her instagram handle @tiwasavage on Thursday.
“Don’t let being a woman hinder you, I have and still have to fight to get people to respect and appreciate my work and not limit me because I am female so this really encourages me to keep pushing and breaking boundaries.
It’s true when they say your brightest moments usually come after your darkest times.
Keep your head up and work hard through it. The same people laughing at you will celebrate you,’’ Savage said.
“Do not let anything hold you back because you are a mother, wife, young, older or a female.
“You can never leave a footprint that will last if you are always working on tiptoes,” she said further quoting Leymar Gbowee, popular Liberian female activist.
Savage also urged her fans to put God first, enjoy life, love, be a good human and do what makes you happy.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the singer, is a mother of one with several awards and a Sony/ATV publishing deal to her name.
