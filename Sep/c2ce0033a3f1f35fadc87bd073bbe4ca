Oh Di Ok singer, Myro,has been in the news lately with stories flying around that he has abandoned his baby mama who just had a child for him. And now, the question on every one’s lips is, did he actually deny his child and abandon his mom? Are the reports true? or could this be just an attempt to fleece the artiste? Whatever the case may be, the allegation is that he impregnated a lady who just gave birth and she is determined to blackmail him into accepting responsibility! A popular quote flying around on social media alleges: “The singer has been described as randy and a serial heartbreaker and could be in hot soup as the lady will stop at nothing to destroy him. “If there is one weakness he has, it is women. As I speak to you there are watsapp messages which were probably leaked from his phone which he is said to have lost during a recent video shoot. “In the chats the lady is threatening fire and brimstone that unless Myro takes responsibility, she will leak the story to the media along with pictures of their child which she just delivered! “However, Myro keeps denying. This should come as a rude shock to him that the story is finally in the media. Poor guy he can’t even tame his passions.” Meanwhile, in a move that shocked the industry, the flashy musician just acquired new wheels, a Dodge Challenger at a whopping N16m a source revealed. “How could he be so insensitive as to do a thing like this? Word just broke involving him in a messy scandal and before we could sayJackie Robinson, the word out there is that he just bought a brand new Dodge Challenger at a whopping N16m, boy are you kidding me?” a fan queried.
