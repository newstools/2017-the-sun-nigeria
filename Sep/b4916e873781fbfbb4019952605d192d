From Taiwo Oluwadare, Ibadan Oyo State Government has notified the House of Assembly of plans to borrow £5 million, to purchase tractors. This was made known in Governor Abiola Ajimobi’s correspondence to the House of Assembly. The letter was sent last Thursday and read by Speaker Michael Adeyemo. Deliberating on the letter, Adeyemo’s deputy, Musa Abdulwasi, commended the initiative. He said it would enhance agricultural development in the state and urged the Executive to “make judicious use of the fund to achieve a laudable goal of promoting agriculture.” Also, another member,  Segun Olaleye, said the matter should not be discussed on the floor of the House but, at the parliamentary caucus meeting. Speaking to the contrary, the speaker said the matter should be discussed on the floor and added that it was a matter of interest to the people of the state that journalists needed to witness the deliberation. But, Chairman of the Parliament, Segun Ajanaku supported Olaleye’s position as he maintained that the matter is a sensitive one that needed not be discussed openly. The speaker, after unanimous agreement, directed that the matter be forwarded to the Committee on Appropriation and Agriculture, to deliberate on it on September 25, 2017 and present the report to the House, during plenary. On  September 26, 2017, the matter would be listed for deliberation on the floor of the House.
