The African Union (AU) has invited Sudan and South Sudan for a meeting in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa to discuss outstanding security issues between them. Sudan’s Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour, said the joint political and security committee between Sudan and South Sudan received an invitation from the head of the AU High-level Implementation Panel (AUHIP), Thabo Mbeki, to meet again to discuss the outstanding issues between them. He said the AUHIP would hold the meeting in Addis Ababa from May 8 to May 9 to discuss files relating to “implementation of joint cooperation agreements in the security field including border demarcation, the demilitarised zone and the file of sheltering and supporting the armed movements.” Sudan and South Sudan signed a matrix deal on March 8, 2013 in Addis Ababa to implement a previously signed security arrangement, which stipulates an immediate withdrawal of forces from the joint borders, along with establishing a safe demilitarized zone between the two countries. The matrix deal also included other issues related to border demarcation and economy. The agreements did not tackle the issue of oil-rich Abyei. The border issue constitutes one of the biggest barriers hampering the settlement of differences between Sudan and South Sudan. (NAN)
