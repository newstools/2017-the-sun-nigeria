From: Aloysius Attah, Onitsha Leader of the Progressive People’s Alliance (PPA) in Anambra State and a gubernatorial aspirant,  Mr. Godwin Chukwunaenye Ezeemo, has said that he would build a ranch for herdsmen in the state if he emerged governor of the state. Ezeemo said that building a standard ranch for the herdsmen with proper monitoring and facilities  would bring to a stop conflicts between farmers and the herdsmen. He made this promise in Mmiata, Anambra West Local Government Area, during an interactive session with some indigenous farmers and ministers of the gospel from the community who said that the activities of the herdsmen was becoming worrisome. Ezeemo decried the environmental and economic problems these herdsmen activities pose on people and assured that he would insist on a ranch for herdsmen which is a socially acceptable means of transporting  cattle into the  state. He said that these ranches must be regulated and taxes would be paid for every cattle adding that the herdsmen will have proper living quarters built for them and that he would insist on hygienic living for them. Ezeemo said that he would not be a party to white-washing the issue but would insist on policies that would make the environment more hygienic-friendly no matter whose ox is gored. He said   he was driven by passion to develop his state having lived in the United Kingdom for a while and learnt the working of the developed world, knowing that such principles of development practicable there could be translated in Anambra for a healthy state. Ezeemo said that he had decide to live his comfort zone to come home to fix the broken walls of governance  in Anambra for posterity  noting that as an Industrialist,  Farmer, and  seasoned politician he  seeks to mend the broken walls of governance in Anambra under the platform of PPA.
