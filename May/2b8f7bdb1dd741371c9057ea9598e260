By Zika Bobby Sona Group of Industries has recorded a major boost in products awareness campaign as its participation in the Food West Africa Trade Fair drew the attention of consumers and business participants.
Showcasing an array of products from three of its subsidiaries in Lagos, Sales Manager, Euro Global Foods and Distilleries Ltd, Mr. Subir Mazumdar, said the company was using the exhibition as an avenue to engage with business owners as well as enlighten consumers about its products.
Mazumdar stressed that the essence of participating in the exhibition was more of giving business owners samples of the company’s products as well as making people understand what the company stands for.
“We are not really here to sell to customers; it is more of giving them a feel about what we are producing.
Our main target is to get engaged with business owners who are willing to buy our products in large quantities.
