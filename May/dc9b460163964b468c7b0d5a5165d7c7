By Zika Bobby National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) President, Aruna Kadiri, yesterday, passed a vote of confidence in the Prof. Is’haq Oloyede-led Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB). Kadiri lauded Oloyede for conducting a credible 2017 mock Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and turning around the fortune of the board to deliver on its core mandate of conducting matriculation examinations into all tertiary institutions of learning in Nigeria. In a signed statement in Abuja, Aruna said the success of last Saturday’s mock UTME examination was a further testimony to the readiness and preparedness of the JAMB leadership to administer the coming UTME effectively and transparently. “Our field officers from various states across the country gave positive and commendable report of the exercise,” he said. He said NANS welcomed the general overhauling and introduction of far-reaching reforms. This is necessary to restore the dwindling fortune of the board. “Since coming into office, the Prof. Is’haq Oloyede-led leadership of JAMB has introduced far-reaching reforms in its operations and conduct of examinations. These are to safeguard the credibility of the UTME,” he said. He said NANS considered these reforms as far-reaching and capable of restoring the negatively skewed image of JAMB. He said the forthcoming UTME slated for late next month would be a major litmus test for the success of these reforms. “It is our considered opinion that Nigerians of good conscience should rise in unison to support the board in its quest to undertake a reliable and credible examination. We are not oblivious of the fact that like all reforms, the turnaround in JAMB would have its attendant collateral shortfalls. These are manifested in some already resolved technical hiccups. “Notwithstanding, these little hiccups have not and cannot in any way undermine the capability of the Prof. Oloyede-led JAMB to conduct a transparent and credible UMTE.”
