late Chief Anthony Enahoro’s first son , Kenneth , is dead. He died on Sunday, in Benin, at the age of 63. His remains have since been deposited in the mortuary. Addressing newsmen in Benin, yesterday, at the family residence at 10, Aideyan Street, immediate younger brother to the deceased,  Eugene Enahoro, said his elder brother led a fulfilled life and added that no foul play was suspected in his death. Eugene said his brother, who was a politician, was the third person to die in the family, this year. “When a man passes on, you do not suspect any foul play. You do not begin to talk about whether he was sick or not but as long as he is aged, God has called him. “He survived long enough to bury his own father and he is survived by two children. “The matter on ground now is his children. He had basically retired, having buried his father but, he was engaged in politics behind the scene. I personally am not a politician, so, I am not too much into that. His political friends will do that. But, it is unfortunate for the family because since the beginning of this year, this has been the third loss we had in the family.  It is only God that knows how long we are going to live on this earth, but, I will say he was my very good friend and he lived a very good and fruitful life because the important thing in life are those whom you leave behind. “For those of you who are younger, it shows the importance of getting your life together very quickly because in our culture, what we pray for is that strangers should not bury us. So, he has a family and he has children. I am younger than him. So, obviously, it rests upon me now to take charge of his affairs,” he said. A condolence register has since been opened in his honour at his family’s residence in Benin.
