An Owerri Chief Magistrates’ Court, on Wednesday, granted N500,000  bail to one Richard Udeozor, charged with allegedly practicing law with forged certificates. Udeozor was granted the bail to the accused following an application by his counsel, Dr Ikenna Ihezuo. Lawrence Nwakaetie, Imo Chapter Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), had sought police remand of the alleged fake lawyer for impersonation. He told the court that the accused posed a great risk as he could jump bail because he had no traceable relatives. According to Nwakaetie, the alleged fake lawyer also poses great danger to the image of the legal profession if his movements were not curtailed. In her ruling, the Chief Magistrate, Mrs Stella Kadurumba, granted the accused N500, 000 bail with two sureties in like sum. She adjourned the case until June 7 for hearing. (NAN)
