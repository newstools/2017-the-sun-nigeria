Anthony Joshua earned £15million  about (N8.2bn) from Saturday night’s victory against Wladimir Klitschko and could soon become Britain’s richest sportsman. Joshua, felled in the sixth round, bounced back to stop Klitschko in the 11th. He said: ‘I’m emotional because I know I’ve got doubters. But I’m only going to improve. Boxing is about character when you go into the trenches that’s when you find out who you are.’ The 27-year-old demanded a fight against Tyson Fury. He said: ‘Tyson Fury, where you at baby? I want to give 90,000 fans another chance to see good boxing.’ He told BBC Radio 5Live: ‘I knew it was possible to hurt him but I am learning round by round. I’m learning under the bright lights. I don’t come to box, I come to hurt people. With all due respect, I came to hurt him. ‘At the end of the day, I figured out what I had to do and got him done. ‘I’m going back to my council flat with my family to eat some good food. I’m not going anywhere. I’m coming back to Wembley. For the first time here, thank you and for the second I’ll look forward to seeing you here again.’ Klitschko, 41, who was gracious in defeat and hasn’t ruled out a rematch, said: ‘The best man won tonight. We have a (rematch) in contract. But I must analyse what has happened.’
