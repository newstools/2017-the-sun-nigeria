From Tony John, Port Harcourt Two persons have lost their lives after suspected Fulani herdsmen attacked and killed them in Afam Uku, Oyigbo Local Government Area of Rivers State.
The Caretaker Committee Chairman of Oyigbo LGA, Dr. Chisom Gbali, confirmed the incident to journalists.
Gbali said the deceased, both male, were attacked and killed by the suspected Fulani herdsmen on their farmland.
He said: “We woke up this morning to hear the story of the killing of two persons by Fulani herdsmen. I don’t actually know the reason for the killing, but I believe that it has to do with the destruction of farm crops by cattle.”
Another source told Daily Sun: “The victims, I learnt, had questioned the motive behind the destruction of their crops by the herdsmen’s cattle. There might have been hot exchanges between the victims and the herdsmen. One of the victims was from Tai.”
Gbali said seven persons have been arrested in connection with the incident.
Rivers State police spokesman, Omoni Nnamdi, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), told journalists that he had not been briefed about the incident.
