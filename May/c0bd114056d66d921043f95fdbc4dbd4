The Nigeria Boxing Board of Control has joined million Nigerians including the Federal government and the Ministry of Youth and Sports to congratulate the new boxing sensation Anthony Oluwafemi Olaseni Joshua for winning the WBO, WBA and IBF heavyweight titles last Sunday, at the Wembley Stadium in London. President of the NBB of C, Dr. Rafiu Oladipo in his message shortly after emerging the president of NBB of C last Sunday at the National Stadium said he was overwhelmed and proud of his style that saw the Nigerian born boxer defeat his opponent Wladmir Klitscho via knock- out to win the world titles. “Honestly, we at NBB of C are proud of him. His victory for us is a launch pad for greater things to come the way o9f boxing in Nigeria. The new board of the NBB of C will ensure that it builds on the gains of his victory to boost boxing in Nigeria. I am glad that a promoter like Flykite headed by Jenkins Alumona was at the ring side for the Joshua fight and most have learnt a few things. “We’ll endeavour to bring him to bring him to Nigeria and see how best he could help to make professional boxing thrive in the country. Our boxers need fights to get world title opportunities and all of these are dependent on fight purses, opponents, medical facilities and more. Boxing as far as I am concerned is back for good,” Oladipo stated.  Click Here>>>>>>Anti-kidnap and anti-theft device for tracking and listening<<<<<<
