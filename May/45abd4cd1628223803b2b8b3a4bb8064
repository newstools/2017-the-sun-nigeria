From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan Association of Ex-Local Government Chairmen of Nigeria (ASELGON), South-West zone, rose from meeting in Ibadan on Saturday and made a strong case for full autonomy of local governments in the country.  The meeting called on the National Assembly to fast-track legislation on autonomy for the local government to reflect true federal system as being practised in the United States, which Nigeria’s democracy is modelled after.
Chairman of the association, Albert Ashipa, noted that the lack of autonomy of the third tier of government has rendered councils redundant for too long and has been responsible for lack of grassroots development in the country.  He noted that the National Assembly and President Muhammadu Buhari have been working to achieve autonomy for local government, while  appealing to governors and state houses of assembly to support the effort.  Ashipa, a former Imeko Afon council boss in Ogun State, who read a communiqué issued at the end of the meeting, said “The constitution of Nigeria recognises the third tier of government and its autonomy but this is only on paper and that is why development and governance have not reached people at the grassroots.
“The association implores the National Assembly to fast-track legislation on autonomy for the local government to reflect true federal system as being practised in the US, which Nigeria’s system is modelled after.
