From Chris Anucha, Port Harcourt The body of the paramount ruler of Umuebulu community, in Etche Local Government Area of Rivers State, His Royal Highness, Eze Sunday Njoku, has been found, seven years after he was kidnapped from a church in a commando-style raid on June 13, 2010, during a service at the Assemblies of God Church, Umuebulu.
During the operation, which led to his eventual kidnap, two young men who tried to save him from the grips of the gun-totting kidnappers were shot dead. Stray bullets hit many worshippers, as the kidnappers shot sporadically before whisking the monarch away. He was later murdered in their custody.
Daily Sun gathered that several efforts by the police to locate the late monarch proved abortive, until the suspects were arrested and they confessed to the killing of their victim. It was also through their cooperation that Eze Njoku’s remains were found.
Confirming the development, the royal father’s eldest son, Prince Chide Njoku, said plans have been concluded to bury the remains of the late monarch on Saturday, May 6, 2017.
According to him, the General Superintendent of the Assemblies of God, Rev. (Dr.) Chide Okoroafor, is expected to conduct the funeral service. He disclosed that the monarch was a staunch member and financier of Assemblies of God in the area, and single-handedly established the Umuebulu branch of the church.
Before his abduction and murder, Eze Njoku was the chairman of Umuebulu community. His community hosts over 58 oil wells, two flow stations and many multinational oil and gas companies, among others.
