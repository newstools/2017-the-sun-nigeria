The Director-General of the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), Mr. Alex Okoh and his counterpart at the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Ms. Hadiza Bala Usman, have reviewed the nation’s maritime industry and agreed on the framework for evaluation of the ports concession agreements.
They have also assessed the infrastructural challenges at the ports and the ways to address them, while pledging to deepen their cooperation in an effort to give Nigerians the best of services.
Speaking while receiving the NPA boss in his office yesterday, in Abuja, the BPE Director General said collaboration was necessary for a sustained development of the maritime industry.
“It has also become necessary in order to enhance efficiency and service delivery at Nigerian ports,” Okoh said.
He said the Bureau would constantly liaise with the NPA to ensure that the concessionaires keep to the terms of the covenants they signed with the government and also ensure that the agreements that are due for review were done expeditiously.
In her remarks, NPA MD explained that synergy between both agencies would ensure an all-encompassing review process of the ports concession agreements.
