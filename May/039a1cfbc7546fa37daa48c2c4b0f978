Senate Minority Leader, Godswill Akpabio, has endorsed the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike for a second  term, saying the state needs his developmental prowess to be completely repositioned. He described Governor Wike as the best performing governor in the country. Commissioning the completed Kpopie-Bodo Road in Gokana Local Government Area yesterday, Akpabio thanked God for allowing him to witness another governor in the Niger Delta who believed in profound development. He commended Governor Wike for diligently constructing the Kpopie-Bodo Road, which, he said, had given the people of the area a sense of belonging. He said: “From the pictures I have seen here, I wonder how you people  lived before Wike  became governor. Oh my people, you must have suffered. This road will help revive the economy of the area.” He said by creating access to communities of Gokana, Governor Wike had empowered them and given them the leverage to grow. In his remarks, Governor Wike said his administration had fulfilled the promise it made to Gokana people, without giving excuses. He regretted that the former Commissioner for Works under the Amaechi  administration, Mr. Victor Giadom, who hails from Gokana Local Government Area allowed a project under his supervision to be abandoned. He said Akpabio was invited to commission the project because he was one of the pillars of support during the electioneering period. He stated that he would continue to deliver democracy dividends to the people of the state. Commissioner for Works, Iheanyichuwu Bathuel, said the road, which is about 10 kilometres, had been fitted with streetlights. Secretary to the State Government, Sir Kenneth Kobani lauded Governor Wike for his commitment to the development of Ogoni land. He assured the governor of the support of Ogoni people in his future political endeavours. Highpoint of the occasion was conferment  of a chieftaincy title on Governor Wike by the Gokana Traditional Rulers Council.
