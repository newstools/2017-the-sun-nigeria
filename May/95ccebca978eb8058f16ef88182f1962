Popular celebrity hang out, O’Jez, will today host in grand style Social Clubs Day, as a build-up to the Lagos at 50 grand anniversary which holds on May 27.
Social clubs have always been an integral part of the uniqueness and development of Lagos. 50 of such clubs will be the center of celebration today. The objective is to bring to life the Lagos heritage spirit and remind citizens of the grand history and rich culture that birthed Africa’s most industrious state.

I thank Governor Akinwummi Ambode, organisers of Lagos @ 50 anniversary and our clientele who have been with us for almost two decades.”
