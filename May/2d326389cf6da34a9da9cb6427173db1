In demonstration of its commitment to deliver superior and innovative banking solutions to its customers,  United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc, has announced the launch of a brand new mobile banking application with many user-friendly features.
The new mobile app, which comes with the biometric log-in feature for secure, personalised access is now available for download on Apple and Google play app stores.
The UBA Mobile Banking App has been tailor-made to enhance ease of banking by enabling customers to carry out their transactions without visiting a branch.
Other features of the app, highlighted by UBA’s Head of Digital Banking, Dr. Adeyinka Adedeji, include, “a more interactive, user-friendly interface, ATM/branch locator for easy access to the bank’s touch-points, easier airtime top up via direct selection of contacts from the phone address book, auto reminder for bill payments and recurrent transfers.”
He further stated that the app has fewer clicks, thereby allowing easier navigation and faster transactions. Customers using the One Time Password (OTP) can perform transactions of up to N200,000. The bank has also introduced a round-the-clock live chat platform to the app to further interface with customers.
