U.K: May accuses EU officials of ‘threats’, attempt to affect election British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday said in a statement issued in London that some EU officials had made “threats” to Britain and wants the Brexit negotiations to fail. She accused them of trying to affect the result of a general election on June 8. “There are some in Brussels who do not want these (Brexit) talks to succeed,’’ May said. She said that whoever leads Britain after the election faces “one over-riding task: to get the best possible deal for this United Kingdom from Brexit’’. “In the last few days, we have seen just how tough these talks are likely to be, Britain’s negotiating position in Europe has been misrepresented in the continental press. “The European Commission’s negotiating stance has hardened. Threats against Britain have been issued by European politicians and officials. “All of these acts have been deliberately timed to affect the result of the general election,’’ May said. (Source: NAN)
