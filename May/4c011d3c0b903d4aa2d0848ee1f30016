From David Onwuchekwa, Nnewi Chief Rommy Ezeonwuka, member of Board of Trustees of the All progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has expressed fears on the possibility of the party to win the November 18 gubernatorial election in Anambra.
Ezeonwuka said there were no indices on ground to show that the party or Governor Willie Obiano was ready for the contest which would determine the future of APGA in Nigeria.
The chieftain told newsmen in Oba, Idemili South yesterday that opposition parties in Anambra were catching-in on the lacklustre attitude of government to permeate the nooks and crannies in the state.
Ezeonwuka, who is also the spiritual leader of APGA, said he was worried because of the seeming lacklustre approach of APGA ahead of the election.
“As a chieftain of APGA, I have seen lots of things going wrong, but, there are no efforts to correct them after series of warnings. As the incumbent government, we are conceding a lot of things to the opposition. It looks that they have discovered that there is a free field for them to do what they wish. How can we be looking on while the opposition is taking over the grassroots of the state, how can they be under our nose to strategise on how to oust us from government house through the polls and nothing is being done.
“It is an insult that people from other states could come here and boast about winning APGA, when their states are not better than Anambra, where everything is working’’ well.
“The real politicians are not being carried along; I wonder how we can convince our people with these officials in government who are not close to them.
“This is like a football match and I have said it over and over that we need people who can score goals, the Governor is the coach, it is time to effect some changes so that we won’t be disappointed.
“From the spiritual angle I can see that we have not done enough to participate and win this all important election.
“The party, APGA where am a BoT member is not being carried along, other parties are meeting but APGA is not meeting to discuss this election,” he said.
Ezeonwuka urged Obiano to mount pressure on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to deploy more machines to cover the eligible voters in the ongoing registration exercise.
He however said that it was not late to change strategy and proffered panacea for the victory of APGA in November.
“Election is not easy. In election you have to make friends, you have to cut-across, you have to negotiate, you don’t win while sitting in your house, you just need more friends than enemies, not even the big parties win alone.
“Some of the aides of the Governor are not home based before now, I have not said they should be removed but those people should go to their people and find out who the stakeholders are and get them on board,” he said. fears/sd
