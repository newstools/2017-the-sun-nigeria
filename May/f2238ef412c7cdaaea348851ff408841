Emmanuel Macron has beaten Marine Le Pen in Sunday’s French election and taken more than 60 per cent of the vote, according to several early exit polls. Polling conducted by Ipsos, Ifop and BVA all gave Mr Macron, the pro-business candidate, a strong lead over Front National leader Marine Le Pen. It comes after a massive hacking attack on Mr Macron’s campaign database over the weekend which saw hundreds of thousands of private emails and official documents dumped online.
