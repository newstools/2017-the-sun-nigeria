From Wole Balogun, Ado Ekiti Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, yesterday, accused President Muhammadu Buhari of running a government of terror meant to muzzle the opposition.
Fayose also accused the President of going after Igbo leaders in the opposition by desperately scheming to cow them through continuous harassment and intimidation.
Fayose spoke in a reaction to the reported raiding of the home of the Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, by security agencies.
He said: “This is a calculated and sustained attempt to silence all the Igbo leaders that are not in the All Progressives Congress (APC) with Buhari ahead of the 2019 general elections because he knows it is a no go area for his party. They have gone from the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kalu, to the Chairman of Capital Oil, Ifeanyi Ubah and now the Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu. This is muzzling of democracy and it is time we saved our nation beyond party line from the hands of the terrorists.
“Obviously, it is too early to rate this government that has turned to government of terror using the DSS and Police as agents of terror. This certainly is not the change we bargained for. We have lost this democracy to military junta of the past masquerading as democrats and we must rise as a people to defend it. But I assure Nigerians that this period shall pass. Nigeria will once again be free from the hands of the agents of darkness and terror.”
