v  Identification of maternal mental disorders: Simple questions asked during pregnancy and in the postpartum period may help to identify women at greater risk for mental disorders, for instance: Depression: “How much of the time during the last month have you felt down hearted and blue?” Anxiety: “How much of the time during the last month have you been a very nervous person?” Psychosis: “Have you been receiving any special messages from people or from the way things are arranged around you?” v  Management and Care The hopeful message is that 70-80 per cent of women with maternal mental disorders can be successfully treated and recover! This is good news for the woman, her infant and her family! The woman and her partner, if appropriate, should be involved in education about maternal mental disorders, treatment and decision-making. Another positive message is that to a large extent, the identification and management of most of these mental disorders can be done at primary health care level, by first line interveners, incorporated into primary health care routines. The Way Ahead For Mrs. Eke Please, take her for proper assessment with a psychiatrist. She may need medications depending on the severity of the depression, but counseling and therapy is a MUST. Taking the children from her will not help, rather this may make the depression worse. The good news like I said earlier is that depression is treatable. All the best.  •CONCLUDED
