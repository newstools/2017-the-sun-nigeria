By Itoro Godwin Eruwen community in Ikorodu, Lagos, has sent a “Save Our Souls” to  Governor Akinwunmi Ambode and the Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, to rescue them from land-grabbers.
The community alleged that the land-grabbers, who were invited by two aggrieved indigenes of the community, have been threatening their lives.
The community head, Chief Kolawole Olutusi, said their predicament started in 2015 when Justice M.A. Savage  of the Lagos State High Court made a pronouncement granting the family absolute possession of the parcel of land situated at Eruwen, off Obafemi Awolowo Way, Ikorodu.
According to him, the judge  ruled that the land belonged to the Adegbalujo descendants of Itun Nla and warned other families fighting for it in the area to hands off.
He said: “We have gone to Zone 2 police command, Onikan, and state command headquarters, Ikeja, to complain about threats to our lives, and nothing has been done.
“That is why we are calling on Governor Ambode and IGP Ibrahim Idris to wade into the matter, as some aggrieved parties have stormed the community with thugs and land-grabbers, who are selling our land and threatening to wipe out the community members, if we challenge them. The thugs have been boasting that the police would not save us.”
