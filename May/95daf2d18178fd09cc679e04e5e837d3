From Petrus Obi, Enugu Gunmen Tuesday night shot dead the police orderly attached to Enugu State Deputy Governor, Mrs. Cecelia Ezeillo, throwing the entire Enugu Government House into mourning.
The victim, Police Sgt. Helen, as part of her daily routine, went home after work and was attacked by gunmen, who, first, took away her phones and handbag before shooting her.
Narrating how the incident happened, a close Government House source said: “She had left the Government House, after the day’s job and was dropped off at home. At home, she had removed her clothes and dropped her service pistol before her attackers struck.”
Our source disclosed that before she was attacked, she called her fiancée, who allegedly told her he was on his way to her house.
He said: “They were still talking on the phone when the gunmen attacked and shot her.
“It’s not an assassination case. Somebody can be at the wrong place and at the wrong time. They stole her bag and phones. Let us wait and see what happens, how the investigation will turn out.”
When contacted, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Ebere Amarizu, confirmed the incident, describing it as “a painful news.”
He, however, said he was yet to establish what happened before making further comments.
Said he: “If you look at what happened, it is painful and sad to hear that an aide to deputy governor was shot dead.
“We can’t really say exactly what happened, but we know that she was attack and killed by bandits.
“We are working hard to unravel the reason and motive for the murder. We have commence investigation and manhunt for the suspects.”
