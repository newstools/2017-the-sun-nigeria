By Zika Bobby Board of Trustees (BoT) member of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Chief Rommy Ezeonwuka has said unless Ndigbo unite, development would continue to elude the South East region. In a statement,  Ezeonwuka said unity is the only tool that could remove the region from marginalisation, youth unemployment and under development, adding that an Igbo presidency would come the day the region works as a team “The only thing stopping us from producing the president of Nigeria is our inability as a people to speak with one voice. We have the resources, we have capable and qualified men and women. The day we agree and begin to speak with one voice, things would begin to change for the better,” he said.He commended the South East Senate Caucus Chairman, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe for playing a major role in perfecting the bail conditions of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu who has been in detention since October 14, 2015. The Igbo leader said there is a lot to learn from Kanu’s two-year incarceration. “The time has come for Igbo to live as one indivisible entity. We are too divided as a people. We must learn from what has happened to our son, Kanu. We should be more focused on how to restructure and make the South East the cynosure of all eyes. We have suffered enough as a people. Let us come together and rebuild our region’’. Let the Igbo billionaires come home and invest. Let them bring their money home. Enough of helping to develop other regions. Let us redirect our focus to the South East. That is the only way we can be more respected as a people,” he said. He lauded Justice Binta Nyako of the Abuja Federal High Court for granting the IPOB leader bail, saying the release was long over due as he called on Kanu to meet with the leadership of Ohanaeze and other groups and forge a common front in moving the Igbo agenda forward.
