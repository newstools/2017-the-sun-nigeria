Spokesman of the South South Congress and Edo FA Chairman, Frank Ilaboya, said in a statement that the event scheduled for Saturday, May 20th will hold at Government House Benin City, with top dignitaries from across the region and indeed nationally expected. Edo Sate Governor, Godwin Obaseki, is the Chief Host, even as indications emerged that other state chief executives from across the region are expected or will send delegates to the event. Time has been fixed for 6:30, on the day. Obaseki, said he has taken personal interest in the progress of the NFF President, because of his sagacity, readiness to learn and application of his energetic youthfulness to bringing the best to Nigerian football. “He is indeed a son in whom the whole of the South South is well pleased,” Obaseki was quoted as saying. The South South region comprises Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross Rivers, Delta, Edo and Rivers states.
