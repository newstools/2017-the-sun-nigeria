The friendship between Bola Shagaya and immediate former Nigeria first lady, Patience Jonathan, is still waxing strong. The billionaire businesswoman seems determined to prove that true friendship exists in a realm where friendship and enmity do not last. Contrary to rumours that she has abandoned her close friend, Patience Jonathan, investigation revealed that the two remain as close as ever.
Shagaya, an Ilorin-born businesswoman remains one of the few women that are still standing by Patience Jonathan since her husband, Goodluck Jonathan, lost the presidential election. Not a few  thought  Shagaya was in the relationship for money and influence when the duo became friends at the dawn of Jonathan’s emergence as vice-president after the 2007 general election.
Their friendship was allegedly frowned upon by the then first lady of Nigeria, Turai Yar’ Adua, but the latter’s efforts to drive them apart were futile.  To their credit, the two have remained inseparable in spite of their differences in terms of age, tribe and religion.
These two friends of all time were both sighted at the just concluded wedding ceremony between Halima Babangida and Auwal Abdullahi in Minna  and they were looking really good together  as ever.
To corroborate their friendship again, they were also present at the book launch of Hon. Dino Melaye in Abuja last week, where they posed for  pictures and laughed heartily  to  dispel any doubts by  their critics who thought they were no longer on good terms.
