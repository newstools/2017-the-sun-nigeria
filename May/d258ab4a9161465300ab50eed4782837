By Sunday Ani Lawyer to the freed leader of Radio Biafra and Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu,  Francis Mgboh has commended former governor of Abia State, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu for his efforts at ensuring that his client was released on bail. He said the former governor’s courage and determination toward the cause, was a master stroke that ensured the release on bail of the IPOB leader. In his commendation letter to Dr. Kalu, he maintained that the entire Igbo appreciated the former governor’s role, adding that his contribution had confirmed his pursuit for sustainable peace and reconciliation among various ethnic and religious groups in Nigeria. He also charged  Kalu not to relent until other Biafra agitators still in detention regained their freedom. “Although, Igbo and well-meaning Nigerians are still yearning for the release of Kanu’s colleagues, they naturally expect that you would not relent in your efforts to see that this objective is actualised in a short while. We equally urge you to extend our appreciation to other good spirited Nigerians, whom you teamed up with to facilitate his release,” he said. Mr. Mgboh maintained that Kalu’s political sagacity and brinkmanship as evidenced in behind the scene negotiations for Kanu’s release have clearly shown that the business mogul is a political colossus, a consummate negotiator, a team player and a bridge builder. He expressed satisfaction that at a time when the political consciousness among the Igbo is at its lowest ebb, God has used the former governor to bring them back on course. The lawyer however, added that Kalu’s effort at securing Kanu’s release from detention has somewhat doused the political temperature in the polity. “Once again, we salute your courage and timely intervention in this matter, which has somewhat doused the political temperature in the polity.”
