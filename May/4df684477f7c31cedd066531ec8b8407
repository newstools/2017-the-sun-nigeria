FROM CHRIS ANUCHA, PORT HARCOURT A group in Rivers State, Ekpeye Youths Congress (EYC), has urged the Federal Government to investigate the alleged plot   by the Inspector General of Police,  Idris  Ibrahim, to kill the state governor, Chief  Nyesom  Wike. Recall that Governor Wike, once again, alleged a plot by the Inspector General of Police to kill him. The governor also expressed concern that the appropriate authorities had never bothered to investigate this allegation. Reacting to the development,  Ekpeye Youth Congress, in a statement signed by its President General, Comrade Dan Igbudu, condemned the Federal Government for the ‘graveyard’ silence it had maintained over various allegations of threat to the governor’s life. The group explained that security of citizens should be paramount to the government, and wondered why it chose not to investigate the governor’s allegation. The congress described Governor Wike as, an illustrious son of Rivers State and a worthy son-in-law of Ekpeye and warned: “Wike will not be allowed to be humiliated by federal agencies, the way the former governor of Bayelsa State, Diepriye Alamieyeseigha was humiliated before his untimely death… “The instigation of the federal agencies, against the Rivers State government is politically-motivated, and it is aimed at stifling him to submission and if possible, eliminate him because of his uncompromising stance.”
