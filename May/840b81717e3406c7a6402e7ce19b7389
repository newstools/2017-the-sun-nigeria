The protesters who spent over three hours, urged Nigerians to shun those blackmailing the National Assembly, especially Senators Andy Uba and Dino Melaye. Speaking to newsmen, President of the Coalition of Civil Society Groups, Etuk Bassey Williams, said  they were out to speak against incessant blackmail and propaganda against people in public places, especially the national assembly. He said: “We observed very recently that the image and integrity of National Assembly has been dented by unscrupulous elements, who peddle rumours and propaganda, especially blackmail against members of National Assembly. “First on the line was the Senate President, followed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara. It was also followed by Senator Dino Melaye, when it was rumoured that he never went to school, and the latest of it was Senator Andy Uba. “I want to say this very quickly, that we have written to the school concerned abroad, the California State University, and we can confirm to every Nigerian and the international community that the response we got from the institution was very clear and very straight forward, that Senator Andy Uba graduated from that institution.”
