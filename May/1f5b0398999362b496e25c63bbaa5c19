A bullion van belonging to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Thursday rammed into the convoy of Ibikunle Amosun, governor of Ogun state. The incident occurred at the Ibafo axis of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. According to Channels TV, the bullion van forced the governor’s convoy out of the road in an attempt to overtake it. In the process, the van which was on high speed rammed into one of the governor’s escort vehicles and damaged it. The governor, who was on his way to Lagos state, was said to be unhurt. The situation was said to have left the governor and the team travelling with him in “disbelief and shock.”
