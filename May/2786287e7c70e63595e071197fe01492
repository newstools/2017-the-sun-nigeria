All is set for the commissioning of COSON House, which will hold on Saturday, May 20, in Ikeja, Lagos.
Speaking, Tony Okoroji, COSON chairman said: “COSON House is the first fully owned property of its kind by any association, union, society or group in the history of the Nigerian creative industry. It is instructive that we did not get a penny from the federal government or any government at all to finance COSON House. We did not get one dollar from any donor agency or any foreign institution to build COSON House. It is also instructive that we did not take a loan of any type from any bank to finance COSON House.
“I am proud to say that when the ultra- modern COSON House is commissioned on May 20, we will not owe a penny. The building and facilities within COSON House fully belong to musicians across Nigeria and other stakeholders in the music industry.”
Meanwhile, Okoroji has been appointed patron of the Intellectual Property Law Club of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife. In a letter from the institution, the president of the club, Miss Oluwatomisin Winner Apata, expressed gratitude to Okoroji for his work in intellectual property.
