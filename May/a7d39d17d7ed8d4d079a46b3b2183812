President Muhammadu Buhari will preside over the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting on Wednesday, it was gathered. Recall that President Buhari was absent from two FEC meetings in April, fuelling speculation about his health. The president’s itinerary for the week showed he would be available for the meeting, on Wednesday. “All is now set for Mr President to preside over tomorrow’s (today’s meeting of the federal executive council. I can confirm to you very strongly that Mr President will be at the Council Chambers for FEC meeting tomorrow (today),” a source told Daily Trust. The president resumed duties on Tuesday taking briefs from Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, and Maikanti Baru, group managing director of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Aisha, the president’s wife, also allayed fears about her husband’s health, saying it is not as bad as being perceived. FEC is the highest decision making organ of the government. It comprises the president, the vice-president and all the ministers.
