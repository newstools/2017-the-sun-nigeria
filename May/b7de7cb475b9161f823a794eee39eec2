Ace actress, Liz Benson is set to thrill movie buffs in a new movie entitled, Busted.
Busted tells the story of Queen, a girl born into a decent home but whose father’s strictness and mother’s ignorance lead her into the arms of a maid who changed her entire life. Now as a grown woman, unknown to her parents, Queen has a different orientation to life and has taken to a new lifestyle. She eventually meets ‘the love of her life’ in Blessing, another beautiful young lady who willingly surrenders to the lifestyle due to the economic hardship.
But unfortunately for the lovers, the National Assembly passes a bill against same sex marriage. However, they choose to ignore biblical beliefs and what society thinks of them and this leads to the tussle that tests their love for one another.
Produced by Lisa Onu, Busted was executively produced by Ifeanyinwa Face Ikuku and directed by Pat Oghre and Damijo Efe-Young. It stars top actors including Kate Henshaw, Tony Umez, Paul Obazele, IK Ogbonna, Lisa Onu, Brian Okwara, and Chika Okpara among others.
