By Omodele Adigun As the country loses over N7.5 billion annually due to piracy, practitioners in the film industry have been urged to embrace effective distribution channel as the way out.
According to a film maker, Mr. Kunle Afolayan, piracy robs producers in the country a great chunk of revenue due to them and counseled that Nollywood practitioners should take their destiny in their hands by also embracing preventive and protective measures.
Afoloyan,  who who gave the advice  during a live radio programme, Fidelity SME Forum ,Tuesday in Lagos, lamented that as one of the victims of piracy, film business in the country is a tough one as “it takes much time to recoup the invested capital.”
He, however, recommended pres-selling of movies as the magic wand to turn the situation around for a huge profit, even if the work is pirated.
His words: “Your film can get pirated and at the same time, you can make a huge returns on investment somehow. If you look at the Hollywood, most of the Hollywood films are found on the streets of Lagos even before the films are released all over the world. Why are they still declaring profits of millions of dollars? It is the structure. And the structure is distribution.
“They have effective distribution there. Before their films are even released, they are already pre-sold. Pre-sold in the sense that, a week before the film is released, cinemas all over the world; television stations all over the world would ask for two-year retail; two-year television rights, and they would be paid for.
