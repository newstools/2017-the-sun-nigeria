From Noah Ebije,  Kaduna North’s socio-cultural group, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has warned outsiders, perhaps,  non-northerners  to desist from fanning embers of discord between the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Muhammadu  Sanusi 11 and the Kano State government over the ongoing probe of the account books of the emirate. This was contained in a communique issued and signed by the national publicity secretary of the Forum,  Muhammad Ibrahim Biu,  at the end of its National Executive Council (NEC) held at the weekend in Kaduna. It would be recalled that Kano State House of Assembly had on Wednesday set up an eight-man committee to investigate the Emir over alleged misappropriation of the emirate council’s funds, anti-Islamic practices, among others. However, ACF expressed satisfaction over the peace initiative brokered by the Northern States Governors Forum (NSGF) in Kaduna,  hoping  that the decisions taken would continue to be respected in the interest of peace and stability of the North and Nigeria in general. According to the ACF’s communiqué, “The attention of the leadership of Arewa Consultative Forum has been drawn to the simmering crisis between the Kano State Government and the Kano Emirate Council. “However, ACF is aware of the peace initiative brokered by the Northern States Governors Forum (NSGF) in Kaduna and hope that the decisions taken would continue to be respected in the interest of peace and stability of the North and Nigeria in general. ACF urges all outside interest groups to desist from fanning the embers of discord. “The meeting reaffirmed its belief in the unity of the North and the peaceful co-existence of its people. To this end, the forum appeals to all Nigerians to come to terms with the reality that the current socio-economic challenges the nation is passing through are not beyond redemption and can become history under purposeful leadership.”
