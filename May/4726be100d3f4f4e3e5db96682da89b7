All government offices will observe a one-minute silence on Thursday to remember the victims of the Manchester Arena terrorist attack, with other organisations encouraged to follow suit, the British government said on Wednesday. The one-minute silence would be held “in remembrance of those who died and all others that were affected by the attack in Manchester,” which left 22 dead and 59 injured. “It will begin at 11 a.m. and flags will remain at half-mast on government buildings in central London throughout the day,’’ it said. Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives and the biggest opposition party, Labour, have suspended national campaigns for a general election on June 8 but plan to resume campaign on Friday.
