From Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson, has urged the opposition in the state to learn the art of true democrats with the outcome of the governorship election in Anambra state. Dickson, who, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Francis Ottah Agbo, congratulated Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra for his re-election, said Obiano’s victory was democracy in action. He particularly commended the security agencies, political parties and the political elite for ensuring the election was peaceful. Dickson called on Bayelsa politicians to take a cue from the Anambra election by playing by the rules of the game at all times. He specifically praised the All Progressives Congress (APC) politicians in Anambra State for their maturity and for not taking advantage of the APC-led Federal Government to foment trouble before, during and after the election. According to him, opposition politicians in Bayelsa do not need to use APC as a cover to perpetrate violence and criminality in the state like they did during the last governorship election. He warned that his administration was alive to its responsibility and would, as usual, stop at nothing to bring the perpetrators of crime and criminality to justice. “While I congratulate my brother, Governor Obiano for the resounding victory, I want to particularly commend the security agencies, political parties and other relevant agencies for ensuring the election was peaceful. I am happy that no life was lost and for me, this is good for our democracy. Unlike Anambra, in Bayelsa, elections are conducted at the price of several lives with records of deaths and mayhem visited on many hapless citizens in various communities by mindless brigands who clearly are acting for those who do not respect the democratic process and who equally have scant regard for the sanctity of lives and property,” he said.
