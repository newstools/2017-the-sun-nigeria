Osinbajo assured at the meeting, which had in attendance the Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola and the Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun,  that “we are completely committed to ensuring that we play our part in the arrangement and we think that this, possibly, is one of the clearest pathways in a long time” In his remarks, Puliti expressed satisfaction with government’s cooperation and commitment to reform of the power sector. He noted that the partnership between the World Bank and the federal government is a model which would add great value to the power sector in Nigeria. Puliti equally praised the Buhari Presidency for the remarkable feat achieved in the ease of business ranking released recently by the World Bank, noting that it is a major milestone for the country’s economic reform programme. Fashola later told State House Correspondents, after the meeting, that the delegation was in the State House to brief Osinbajo on the progress made by the federal government, working with the World Bank on the Power Sector Recovery Programme.
