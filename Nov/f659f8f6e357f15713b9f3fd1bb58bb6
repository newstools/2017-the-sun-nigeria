It was such a beehive of activities comprising of good music, laughter and fun for the former students of Trinity Secondary School, Lagos as the class of 91 held the maiden edition of it’s convention and gala nite last Friday.  The activities kicked off with empowerment and health talks to benefit all members of the alumni.  Welcoming guests to the ceremony, President of the TSS Class of 91 alumni, Obinna Awiaka, stated that it was great to see former classmates, some for the first time after 26 years. “Today’s programme is actually a convention. 26 years after we’ve left secondary school, we are meeting ourselves for the first time. And we decided that instead of just meting to eat and drink, we should empower ourselves with information, trainings and teach,” Awiaka said. Also speaking, the chairman of the organizing committee, Emmanuel Onwubiko, said that the idea behind the convention is to come to the aid of some of its members who will be needing it. “We have found out that it is not just about us. We found out that we have some people that have been out of job. We’ve been like a brotherhood so we want to empower people and give them some knowledge by providing them with information. It’s just not about making money. “We picked out speakers from people that have impacted us. We went through a whole lot of lists but we picked the ones that have a whole lot to do concerning our vision. We intend to empower people. We have gone through the lists, collected business plans and we’ll be funding the ones that are viable,” he said. Keynote speaker at the convention, Ubong King, the CEO of Protection Plus Services, a private security outfit, called on members of the alumni to take advantage of the Nigerian business environment to expand their horizon. He also decried a situation where the girl child is conditioned not to excel saying the practice must stop.
