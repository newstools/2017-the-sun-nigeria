Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has declared open grazing illegal in the state. In an early morning broadcast, yesterday, the governor appealed “to all citizens to be law abiding, no one should take law into his hands. We have put adequate machinery to enforce the law.” The state capital, Makurdi was calm, yesterday but the international cattle market at the north bank area of the capital city was tense. Chairman of the Joint Task Force on the enforcement of the Anti-open grazing law, Col. Edward Jando (retd), said the vigilante group wis ready to perform its duty.
