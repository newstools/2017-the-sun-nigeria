the All  progressives congress Young Entrepreneurs (AYE), has urged Abia State Government to pay retired civil servants pensions and arrears of over 18 months. The group made the same appeal to parastatals, state and local governments staff, who are owed up to nine months arrears too. In a statment by AYE’s acting Publicity Secretary, Tony Chuku, the group reacted to last week’s protest by state pensioners in Umuahia. The group wondered “why an oil-producing state, with a high commercial area like Aba, would owe salaries of workers while neighbouring non-oil producing states pay as and when due.” AYE said it was “the worst injustice meted on pensioners and workers who spend their active years working for the state but, at the end of the day, are denied  of their well-deserved wages. The goup asked why the state governor would employ so many aides and would not pay pensioners, civil servants and contractors.
