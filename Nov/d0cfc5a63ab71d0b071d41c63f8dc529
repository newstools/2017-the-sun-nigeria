By Chidera Akalonu South African based goalkeeper, Daniel Akpeyi is expected to make a late arrival to Super Eagles camp in Morocco today after missing his flight in Lagos. Akpeyi who was initially billed to depart Lagos on Monday for Rabat was only able to catch a flight out of Lagos yesterday. New kid on the block Francis Uzoho on his part, arrived Morocco from Spain yesterday ahead of Friday’s game against Algeria in the World Cup 2018 Qualifiers. Uzoho would begin his push for a spot in the team against Ikechukwu Ezenwa and Daniel Akpeyi. A total of 20 players are presently training under the watchful eyes of coach Gernot Rohr who is expected to make a decision on who will be in goal against Algeria on Friday and also against Argentina in four days time. Meanwhile, Super Eagles captain Mikel Obi is yet to join the team in Morocco and the coach says there will be no extension of the deadline. Nigeria are without several key players, namely Victor Moses, Elderson Echejile, Odion Ighalo, Ogenyi Onazi and Moses Simon for the matches against Algeria and Argentina. Olanrewaju Kayode and Kenneth Omeruo have thus been handed late call-ups by coach Gernot Rohr. Uncapped Henry Onyekuru, Chidiebere Nwakali and Francis Uzoho will get a chance to stake for places on the squad to Russia 2018. The Super Eagles started their preparations for the World Cup qualifier against the North Africans on Tuesday evening. The team will  fly out to Algeria on Thursday ahead of the game on Friday night, before leaving for Russia on Saturday for the friendly against Argentina in Krasnoder, on Tuesday, November 14 .
