By Monica Iheakam Argentine legend, Diego Armando Maradona  has accused coach Jorge Sampaoli of throwing away the national team’s prestige. Maradona’s accusation is coming hours after  Argentina’s 2-4 loss to the Super Eagles of Nigeria in an international friendly in Krasnodar, Russia. The former Boca Juniors and Napoli striker,  bashed the faltering Argentina team for the humiliating loss  and called on the Argentina Football Association to give him a second chance to tinker the La Albiceleste. According to espn.com, Maradona compared Argentina’s winning records in the hands of recent manager claiming that it was time for Sampaoli to be shown the exit, adding that him (Maradona) is the best candidate to replace the embattled coach. Writing on his Instagram page, Maradona wrote: “I am angry because they have thrown away our prestige, but it’s not the fault of the lads,” he said. “I WANT TO COME BACK!!!” “Who won most? We draw our own conclusions.” Maradona took Argentina to the World Cup in 2010 by the skin of their teeth, finishing fourth in the South American qualifying group with the same number of points (28) that Sampaoli’s side achieved this year. He was unceremoniously sacked after a 4-0 defeat by Germany in the quarter-finals in South Africa. It was later claimed by the legendary player that he could have continued had he allowed the AFA to replace his entire coaching crew.
