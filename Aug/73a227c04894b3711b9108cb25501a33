• Give us more time, ruling party begs Nigerians From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday asked the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to resign so the country can move forward. The opposition party said the APC administration has been a huge failure in every ramification. National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Prince Dayo Adeyeye, stated this in a telephone chat with Daily Sun. Adeyeye spoke against the backdrop of the plea of the chairman of the Progressive Governors’ Forum and Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha, that Nigerians should bear with the APC led government over the state of things in the country. The spokesman of the opposition party said the APC government, apart from tarnishing all the achievements of the PDP in the 16 years it governed the country, had plunged the entire country into serious crisis. Adeyeye urged Nigerians not to accept the plea, stating, “it is obvious Nigerians are worse off under the present administration.” “This was a party that promised to turn Nigeria into a paradise, but turned has it into hell instead. Rather than apologising, they should just quit,” Adeyeye insisted. Governor Okorocha had yesterday, in Kebbi State, appealed to Nigerians to give the ruling party more time to fix the country. He said it was too early to judge elected officials on their performance. “We want to appeal to Nigerians not to judge us from past sins or within the two years we have been in the mantle of leadership of this great country. “You should judge us when the mandate entrusted to us expires,” Okorocha said at the opening of a retreat on policy synergy between states and the Federal Government, holding in Birnin Kebbi. He assured that the APC-led administration would meet the expectations of all Nigerians.
