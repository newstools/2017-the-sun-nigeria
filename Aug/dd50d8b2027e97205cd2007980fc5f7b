From Clement Adeyi,  Osogbo Osun State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has vowed to go the whole hog in defeating the opposition Peoples Democratic Party in the 2018 governorship election in the state. The party chairman, Prince Gboyega Famoodun, stated this yesterday in Osogbo, the state capital, in his address to mark the 26th anniversary of the creation of the state. He gave assurance that the party would sweep the polls and install another governor to maintain the incumbency. According to him, Osun has never witnessed the unprecedented infrastructural turn around recorded in the last seven years of the APC administration. “We want continuity and more changes and progress.  That is why APC has to maintain power.  We don’t want any distraction by the opposition party, “he stressed. The party accused the PDP of conspiracy to destroy everything that it had achieved since it came on board.
