About 500 former Peoples Democratic Party  (PDP) councillors have endorsed Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, for a second term in office.
The councillors, who trooped to Government House, Port Harcourt, yesterday, on a solidarity visit, declared that Governor Wike had performed creditably well and deserved to be re-elected.
Chairman of the PDP ex-Councillors Forum, Rivers State chapter, LoveGod Nweze, declared that members of the forum were satisfied with Governor Wike’s numerous projects and programmes for the people of the state.
He said: “We commend Governor Wike for the execution of people-oriented projects across the state.
“We applaud Governor Wike for redeeming Rivers State from the clutches of evil forces, who held the state down. He has invested in the development of the local government areas of the state.”
They thanked God for giving the governor the enablement to work for the people,and urged him to accommodate former councillors in the execution of development projects.
Responding, Governor Wike said the former councillors formed a solid power bloc that would be used to reach out to the grassroots.
He assured the former councillors that the governmen would phase the payment of their severance allowance.
He said: “We will encourage local government areas to pay severance allowance to former councillors. However, we will phase the payment because of the number.”
The governor said the government would reach out to the former councillors through appointments and added that the group would nominate one member each for the seven councils, where vacancies exist.
Governor Wike assured the people that his administration would continue to deliver democracy dividends to the people of the state.
