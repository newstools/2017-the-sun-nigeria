a chieftain of t5he All Progressives Congress (APC), Osun State, Ogbeni Mukaila Adesoye Oni, Adesoye Oni has expressed confidence in the leadership ability of Governor Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola, just as the gubernatorial election draws nearer in the state. Oni, an elder of the state chapter of Community Youth Development National Networks (CYDNN), affirmed his unflinching loyalty to the party under the leadership of its state chairman, Adegboyega Famodun, saying: “The great party still has more dividends of democracy for the good people of the state.” He told newsmen in Osogbo: “When the time comes, the people themselves will analyse the gains of Aregbesola’s government vis-a-vis the meagre allocations to the state from the Federal Allocation and vote for APC again. “If we enumerate the achievements of this administration with open minds, we will agree that Aregbesola is a God-sent to the good people of the state. Since the advent of this government in 2010, we have discovered that the governor has been squeezing water from stone for us to enjoy.” On the senatorial seat won by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on July 8, 2017, the Telemu-born politician admitted that it was a sad event: “Politics is about win some and lose some occasionally. What happened was just a temporary setback from which a lesson has been learnt.” He was of strong conviction that “the party is still very strong and in charge in the state. It was the votes of the APC members and supporters that gave victory to Senator Ademola Adeleke. “The 2018 gubernatorial poll will be a different ball game entirely as our loyal members, who have reinforced their confidence in the governor and party leadership will vote en masse for an APC candidate. It be a different game ball entirely from the July 8 senatorial by-election.”
