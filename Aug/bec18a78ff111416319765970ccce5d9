From Magnus Eze, Abuja The National Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) has set aside Thursday and Friday to hold nationwide prayer for the quick recovery of ailing President Muhammadu Buhari.
The Union will also use the period to seek God’s intervention in its agitation for autonomy for the local governments in the on-going constitution review.  Acting General Secretary of NULGE, Comrade Chuks Aguonye, in a statement in Abuja yesterday, said an emergency National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the union recently agreed to organise the prayer session for the president, especially as he had, before this period, indicated that his administration would pursue autonomy for the third tier of government.
Aguonye said: “To this end, the National leadership of the union has set aside Thursday and Friday, August 17 and 18 (for Christians and Muslims, respectively), for special prayer sessions by all local government workers in the country for his quick recovery. The prayer sessions would also be used to seek the face of God Almighty to intervene in our campaign for the autonomy of Local Government.” He disclosed that the union had also released timetable for nationwide rallies to further mobilise support across the states for their agitation now that the National Assembly had transmitted the bills to the States Houses of Assembly for concurrence. The union maintained that it would not allow what happened during the last constitution amendment process, where many the state governors allegedly prevailed on their state assemblies to kill the bill.
