By Christopher Oji and Victoria Onyejekwe Not long after the clerk of Ikeja Local Government Area of Lagos State, Mr. Shamsideen Abiodun Omotayo, was kidnapped at Imota area of the state, his abductors have demanded a ransom of N20 million.
Narrating how the clerk was abducted, a family member who pleaded anonymity said: “ He was going to the office when he was abducted. His abductors reached us and demanded a N20 million ransom.”
However, Commissioner of Police, Mr. Fatai Owoseni, said he was not aware of the kidnap as no official report was made to the police.
Meanwhile, Public Relations Officer of Lagos State Neighbourhood Safety Agency (LNSA), Mr. Afolabi Olawale, has confirmed the incident, saying the kidnappers demanded N20 million.
He said: “This is to inform you of the kidnap incident of the clerk of Ikeja Local Government, Mr. Shamsideen Abiodun Omotayo. He was abducted at Imota on his way to work in the morning. The kidnappers have so far contacted the Head of Administration of the Ikeja Council Area, Mrs. Mosunmola Otaiku-Okoka. They are demanding N20 million as ransom.
“Efforts are still ongoing by concerned security agencies to rescue him.”
A statement from the Ikeja Local Government, signed by its information officer, Mr. Ademola Bello-Onilegbale, confirmed the incident.
The statement reads: “This is to inform the public about the kidnap of the Ikeja Local Government clerk, Mr. Omotayo Shamsideen, by some notorious kidnappers in the early hours of Wednesday, on his way to work. He has, however, been allowed to speak with his immediate boss and they are requesting for N20 million ransom.”
