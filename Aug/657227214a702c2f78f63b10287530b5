From: FRED ITUA, Abuja Some members of various Houses of Assembly and commissioners in the All Progressives Congress (APC)-controlled states have called on President Muhammadu Buhari to convene a meeting with young people who are dissatisfied with the Nigerian project. The appeal is coming, few days after President Buhari returned from a medical vacation in the United Kingdom (UK), where he spent over 100 days. The APC youth leaders who addressed newsmen in Abuja yesterday, under the aegis of Democratic Youth Congress (DYC), urged the President to listen to agitators and forge a way to regain their trust. Chairman of the group and a member of Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Kassim Mohammed Kassim, who spoke on behalf of others drawn from over fifteen states, said only equity and justice can end the current nationwide tensions.
