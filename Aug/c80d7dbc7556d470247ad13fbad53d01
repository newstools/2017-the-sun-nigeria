Chief of Staff to the Rivers State Governor, Engineer Chukwuemeka Woke, has berated the defeated 2015 Rivers State All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Mr Dakuku Peterside, “for deliberately refusing to understand the tenets of developmental philosophy in governance.” In statement in Port Harcourt yesterday, Woke regretted that Dakuku Peterside has formed the habit of making unguarded comments to gain political attention . He said: “The attention of the Rivers State Government has been drawn to another unfortunate ranting of the defeated Rivers APC Governorship Candidate. “In the unguarded statement published in one of the national dailies, Peterside condemned the dissolution of the State Executive Council by His Excellency, Governor Wike. This is most unfortunate and a proof that Peterside lacks knowledge of the rudiments of governance.” He explained after two years of quality and developmental leadership, Governor Wike needed to inject fresh blood to increase the tempo of delivery of democracy dividends in the state. Woke stated that Governor Wike is rapidly developing the State after Dakuku’s boss raped the coffers of Rivers State. He said Wike has the right to re-jig his cabinet  at any time. “Dakuku spent  four years as Amaechi’s Commissioner for Works with an average of about N300 billion without  any meaningful improvement on the  state of roads. It took the emergence of Governor Wike to develop  the road infrastructure of the State . “Dakuku, a breastfeeding political godson of Amaechi should recall that the Governors of Nasarawa, Borno, Imo, Kano, Bauchi and Lagos, among other APC State governors have since changed their cabinets without anyone raising eyebrows. The 2015 failed APC governorship candidate should keep quiet and allow Governor Wike to concentrate on developing Rivers State,” Woke said.
