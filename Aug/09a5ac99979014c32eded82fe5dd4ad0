Lawmakers from the House of Representatives have endorsed the new  multi-million naira building project of the Industrial Training Fund (ITF) meant for training and other uses. The building, when completed, they said, will  boost the capabilities and capacities of the training agency in improving the capacity of the nation’s workforce and meeting its target. Chairman, House Committee on Industry, Hon. Abubakar  Moriki, who led other members of the committee on an oversite tour of the building in Lagos State last week, extolled the initiative of the Joseph Ari-led ITF to make sure the building gets completed  by 2018. Moriki, at the building, which is known as the Lagos Island area  office, promised to hasten the speedy completion of the multi-million  project by supporting the agency anywhere it needs their help. The ITF Director-General, Ari, said the seven-story building, when completed, would not only serve the agency, but also provide accommodation to different companies that would serve as another means of revenue for  the ITF. He said: “This building, when completed in 2018, will further boost our capabilities to equip more workers in the requisite knowledge needed to improve the skills and abilities of the labour force in the  country.”
