Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho,  says he wants to see his side losing to see how his players react when in the situation. The Red Devils romped to a 4-0 victory over Swansea in the early kick off Saturday afternoon to set up a new club record. For the first time in the club’s 110 year history, United  won their two first matches of the season 4-0, with Lukaku becoming the fifth player to score in his first two appearances for the club after Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Anthony Martial Federico Macheda and Louis Saha. Goals from Eric Bailly, Romelu Lukaku, Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial ensured the visitors came away with a comfortable three points. And with United yet to experience going behind in a game, Mourinho admits he is tempted to see how his side would cope if it happened. “The word that describes it better is confident,” he told reporters in his post-match press conference. “The team start better, confident. The team started the second-half confident. “I want to say, but I don’t want to see if it happens, I want to see the team losing and see the way we emotionally react to it because it’s another stage to be losing and to try to change the result. “Because in this moment everything is going in our favour but you know it’s not always motorway. You always find difficult roads and roadworks and you have to be ready.” With eight goals scored in their first two games, United have made their strongest start since 1907. Last term United won their first three games before suffering defeat to rivals Manchester City and Mourinho is taking nothing for granted this time around. “I prefer to say we started last season with two matches, six points and we finished sixth,” he added. “It’s not a lesson, it’s a reality of football. “Two matches are not the end of the world for people who lose and not paralyzed for people who wins. “I’m happy, of course, and the quality of the performance gives me even more confidence.”
