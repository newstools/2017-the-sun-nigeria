Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Naval Command of the Nigerian Navy, Rear Adm. Victor Adedipe, has inaugurated a 30-man transit accommodation for ratings at the command’s headquarters in Calabar. Inaugurating the accommodation, Adedipe said that the gesture was in furtherance of the Chief of the Naval Staff’s strategic directive in the area of infrastructural development for personnel of the Navy. He said that it would ease the accommodation problems facing the Nigerian Navy personnel in the Eastern Naval Command. “This project has been completed and allocated to the ratings for their use. It is equipped with all the amenities needed for comfort. “I advise the beneficiaries to make good use of it; we in the Navy have a standard for keeping things in proper shape. They have a mandate to maintain it so that the facilities will last. “The ratings, who were hitherto, living in places that were not comfortable, can now live well. “The accommodation will boost their morale and encourage them to perform optimally in their duties,” Adedipe said.
