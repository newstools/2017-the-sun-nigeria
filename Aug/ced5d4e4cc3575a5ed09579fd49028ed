A 28-year-old man, Monday Michael, was on Monday charged before an Ota Magistrates Court in Ogun for alleged assault.
Michael, who lives at No. 36, Fadipe Street, Iyana-Ilogbo, Ota, is facing a two-count charge of assault and conspiracy.
The Prosecutor, Sgt. Chudu Gbesi, told the court that the accused and others still at large, committed the offences on July 25 at about 7.00 p. m. at Iyana-Iyesi, Ota.
