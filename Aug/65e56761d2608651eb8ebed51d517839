By Chinelo Obogo The All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Anambra State, Dr. Tony Nwoye has commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of the party for insisting on a level playing field which he said made it possible for him to emerge as the candidate of the party. In a statement issued by his campaign organisation, he also praised his opponents for putting up ‘a good fight’, even as he said that the victory belongs to the people. “I want to specially thank President Buhari for insisting on a level playing field for the primary, it has shown clearly that the APC is a party that believes in rule of law. I also thank our national chairman, Chief John Oyegun, because without his stance and that of the members of the NWC, Anambra would not be celebrating APC today. He has made the party very attractive. “Every election is a battle and this one was no exception. For those of us who choose to be contenders and go into electoral contests, we go about it with a win-lose proposition. “While it is true that only one person can be elected to fly the flag of our great party, in reality, and certainly in a democracy such as ours, every election is an opportunity for the people to express their will, to have their say in who will lead them in the shaping of Anambra’s future. In this way, each victory belongs to the people. “I also congratulate Senator Andy Uba for his mastery of the political terrain. I cannot claim to have defeated him because he is still the boss. I also commend the leadership of Senator Chris Ngige, who has made the party the beautiful bride in the State. I commend Chief George Muoghalu, Barth Nwibe, Paul Chukwuma, Johnbosco Onunkwo, Chike Obidigbo, Mmadu Nonso, Patrick Nwike, Donates Okonkwo and my sister Adaobi Uchegbu. I ask that they join me as the destination of this journey is not what I can go alone” Nwoye said.
