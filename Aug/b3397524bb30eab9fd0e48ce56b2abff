Abdulkareem made the call in llorin on Tuesday, in an interview. The academic expressed concern that the contents of music and images of most films being produced in recent times in the country contained elements of vulgar contents and obscene images. He noted that the situation was having negative effect on moral values and behaviour of some Nigerians, especially the younger ones. The lecturer suggested that Censor Board be re-invigorated and made to function effectively to check the negative trend. He said checking the contents of music and films in the country would ensure decency in the society and prevent youngsters from being exposed to such vulgar and obscene images. “All artistic contents must be screened before they are released to the public. ‘’Censor Board must come to the rescue in order not to corrupt the society. “Western culture, ICT and globalisation have polluted our rich African culture as we copy everything they do,” he said. Abdulkareem also appealed to the media to desist from promoting derogatory contents that demeaned moral ethics and encouraged illicit acts. “I will urge parents, media houses, educational and religious institutions to salvage the situation by promoting the use of the rich Nigerian culture for harmony and development in the country.” He, however, advised Nigerians to appreciate the originality, rich inspirational and entertaining contents of the local music aimed at promoting moral value in the society.
