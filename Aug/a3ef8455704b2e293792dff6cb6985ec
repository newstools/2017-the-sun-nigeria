From Tunde Omolehin, Sokoto Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State has donated food, baby items and cash to the local farmer whose wife gave birth to quadruplets in the state last week.
The father, Lawwali Maishinkafa Illela, was given the sum of N500,000 to support his farming business while assorted food items and baby wears were presented to the couple at their family home in Illela LGA of the state.
Presenting the items on his behalf, the state Commissioner for Social Welfare, Alhaji Surajo Gatawa, said the state government will continue to cater for the needs of the new born babies and their parents.
“We are here to present these items as a means of support to you. The birth of a child is a moment of joy to us. And because God decided to give you four at the same time, our joys are four-folds. We thank God for this joy and addition to your family and we will continue to monitor the progress of the children through you,” the commissioner told the parents.
