From George Aluo, Houston
Tito Marshal! That is what they call him. His real name however is Humphrey Lee Agunwa. He was one of those who played for Rangers in the early 70s when the club was formed after the Nigerian civil war.
He is an old war horse that is not tired at 72. Those that watched ex Rangers take on Houston Eagles in a novelty match before the Rangers convention would confirm that.
Marshal dazzled during the game as he led the ex Flying Antelopes to beat the young Houston Eagles 2-0.
It was a game in which Samson Siasia, Paul Okoku, Ikem Ude, Stone Igwebuike, Emman Merenini featured. But Marshal stole the show as he displayed the skills that saw him shine for Rangers over 40 years ago. He lasted the whole of the first half and Marshal was ready to go all the way as he refused to be subbed. In fact it took the pleading of Benson Ejindu, Rangers patron for Marshal to step out, even as he received a resounding ovation from the fans.
Marshal told Daily Sunsports that he is still his old self even in his early 70 declaring that once a player is always a player.
“I m still strong at over 70 because of God’s grace upon me. I m happy with this opportunity which the annual convention of our great club has afforded us to do again what we did as young men,” Marshal said.
Ex-Rangers had before the convention proper taken to the pitch against other Nigerian ex internationals in Houston…Houston Eagles in a fun filled match.
