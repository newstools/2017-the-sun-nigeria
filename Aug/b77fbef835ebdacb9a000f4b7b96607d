The Consumer Protection Council (CPC) has dissociated itself from an insinuated N17 million judgment against Coca-Cola by the Supreme Court of Nigeria.
Mr Babatunde Irukera, Director-General of CPC, said this in a statement by Mr Abiodun Obimuyiwa, the Head of Public Affairs of the council, on Wednesday in Abuja.
The Supreme Court had reaffirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal, awarding N17 million against Coca-Cola,Â  a Nigerian International Company for wrongfully terminating the employment of Mrs. Titilayo Akisanya.
The suit was filed on behalf of Akisanya by Babatunde Irukera on February 10, 2012.
Irukera was then a Partner in Simmons Coopers Partners, a law firm in Nigeria that had the incumbent Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) as its Principal Partner.
Akisanya was employed by the respondents as Human Resources Manager on December 11, 2001.
