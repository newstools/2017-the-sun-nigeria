From Jeff Amechi Agbodo, Onitsha The Movement for Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), under the leadership of Comrade Uchenna Madu, has commended the Yoruba Libration Command (YOLICOM) in the South-West geopolitical zone of the country for the step it took on July 27, 2017, by declaring and displaying the Oduduwa Republic flag. National Director of Information of MASSOB, Mr. Edeson Samuel, in a statement, expressed full support of the group for YOLICOM’s aspiration. He said: “The YOLICOM declaration is in line with the quest by MASSOB for restoration of Biafra through non violence approach. This declaration is a welcome development. It is a sign that Nigeria can never stand again. Those agitating for restructuring can now see that no amount of restructuring will save Nigeria from disintegrating. “MASSOB will give every necessary support to YOLICOM and, also, promise to work with the group as a genuine freedom fighting organisation. The call by YOLICOM on United Nations for the dissolution of 1914 amalgamation is in order, because this political entity called Nigeria is owned and controlled by northerners, mostly the Hausa/Fulani.” MASSOB further called on the Middle Belt to “rise and defend its God given land and resources.”
