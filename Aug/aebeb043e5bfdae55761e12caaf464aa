The Head of Political Science Department, College of Education, Oro in Kwara State, Mr. Musbau Abdulkareem, says strong collaboration between private investors and government will revive Nigeria’s moribund textile industries. Abdulkareem said in an interview, on Tuesday, in Ilorin, that revitalising the industries would create jobs, boost rural economy and add value to the country’s economy. According to him, massive investment in the textile industry would also accelerate current efforts to diversify the economy and move Nigeria out of recession. “Nigeria is blessed with rich cotton materials that could make the country the largest exporter of clothes to the outside world, but that is not the case as we still rely on imported clothing materials. “There is more than enough textile industries in Kano and other places in the country. We have quality clothing materials. Why must we continue to rely on and import clothes from Abidjan, Ghana and Italian wears. “It baffles me when I see Nigerians favouring Ghanaian and Abidjan clothes to our own local made despite the richness of our materials. “Government must do something on time to revive our textile industries by channeling more money into the sector,” he said. Abdulkareem urged Nigerians to patronise local fabrics in order to grow the economy and generate more employment opportunities. (NAN)
