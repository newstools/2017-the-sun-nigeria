Switzerland’s Timea Bacsinszky has withdrawn from the U.S. Open due to a lingering hand injury, the world number 24 has said. Bacsinszky, who will also miss this month’s Connecticut Open in New Haven, was carrying a thigh injury during Wimbledon last month but said on Wednesday she had also been troubled by her hand since last year. “Unfortunately, I was forced to pull out of New Haven and the U.S. Open,” Bacsinszky, who reached the French Open semi-finals earlier this year, said on her Instagram account. “My thigh is now much better, but I still need to undertake a few exams for my hand. I cannot express how sad I am to announce such bad news, but my priority… is to let my body heal completely and take all the time needed in order to do so.” The U.S. Open runs from Aug. 28 to Sept. 10 at Flushing Meadows, New York.
