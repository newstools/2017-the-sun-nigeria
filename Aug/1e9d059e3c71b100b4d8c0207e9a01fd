From Jeff Amechi Agbodo, Onitsha No fewer than 100 former members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Nkpor Ward 1 in Idemili North Local Government Area of Anambra State yesterday defected to All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). The leader of the group and former councilorship candidate of PDP, Mr. Obioma Arinze Molokwu, who led others to join APGA at Idemili Council Headquarters said that they took the decision to defect to APGA due to the laudable developmental projects embarked upon by Governor Willie Obiano in the state. Molokwu said that the governor had exemplified good governance in his four years in office and needed to be supported for second term, in order to consolidate on his achievements, saying that they took the bold decision to join the moving train of APGA that has given the state facelift within the shortest period in power. He noted that the Transition Committee Chairman of Idemili, Chief Ralph Nnabuife, who is from Nkpor community has been complementing the efforts of the state governor by embarking upon various developmental projects in the council, which spurred them to join him to lift up the party in the council and to ensure that Obiano emerged victorious in the forthcoming November 18 governorship election. While receiving the defectors at the council headquarters in Ogidi, the Transition Committee Chairman of Idemili North Chief Nnabuife flanked by the member representing Idemili North at the State House of Assembly, Hon. Toochukwu Â Mmegbanaeze, commended the group for appreciating the good work of the governor, which made them to join APGA. He said that Nkpor Ward 1 members of PDP who joined APGA reduced the campaign stress in the area.
