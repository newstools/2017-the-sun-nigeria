Incumbent President of Kenyan, Uhuru Kenyatta of the Jubilee Party, is slogging it out with his opponent, Raila Odinga. Having observed the election proceedings, Mahama stated: “We have followed the whole process and wish to congratulate all on the process thus far. “It is my fervent hope and expectation that the positive, peaceful and orderly atmosphere that we all experienced on August 8, 2017, will continue to prevail as we await the conclusion of this electoral process,” the statement quoted Mahama to have said. Mahama added “Our overall conclusion is that the opening, voting, closing and counting process at the polling stations on August 8, 2017, were credible, transparent and inclusive. “We commend and congratulate Kenyan voters, the staff of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, political party agents, candidates’ agents, the media and all security personnel for their commitment to the democratic process.”
