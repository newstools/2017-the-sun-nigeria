There are prices celebrities pay for stardom but fast rising actress, Juliet Patrick Odigwe was recently offered a price tag she found ridiculous and unacceptable. The Anambra State-born thespian revealed to Inside Nollywood how a certain popular producer in Owerri, Imo State asked her for six rounds of sex for six movie roles. She narrates: “A production manager I met in Owerri came to me and said: ‘Babe, you are so good. I’ll give you six good jobs that can blow you to stardom, but after the six jobs, all I need from you are six good rounds of sex in return’. I gave him an outright ‘no’. I told him I could only take him for shopping when he makes me a star. However, it didn’t end well. Although, he got me two good jobs, I kept reminding him that I could only take him out for shopping. He was pissed off and that was the end of the matter. He stopped calling me for jobs,” Continuing the story of her ordeal in the hands of producers as an up and coming actress, the graduate of Linguistics said: “Some producers won’t come straight to ask you for sex, they will begin by telling you how they love you, how they want to marry you and all kinds of love stories just to get into your pants. “It has not really been easy for me but once one is good, then it’s not really that difficult to hit stardom. Some up and coming actresses actually throw themselves easily and cheaply at  these producers, directors and marketers, so they think everybody is the same. If you complain too much, they de-cast you in a twinkle of an eye, telling you there are a thousand and one girls ready to pay huge amount for the role you just got free.” Odigwe also lamented how she lost her boyfriend after intimating him of her intentions to join the movie industry. “Sadly, my boyfriend broke up with me when I decided to join the movie industry fully. So, I have no boyfriend wahala for now,” she concluded.
