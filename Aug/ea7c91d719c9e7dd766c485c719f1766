Senator Mohammed Hassan (PDP-Yobe) has called on the Federal Government to find a lasting solution to the incessant strikes in the country’s tertiary institutions. Hassan told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja that the ongoing strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) was not healthy for the nation. The lawmaker decried the situation that Nigeria was still grappling with developing its human resources while other Nations have moved ahead in modern human capacity building. According to him, the recurrent strikes sets students back by several steps, thereby affecting their capacity after graduation. “The Federal Government should find a way of nipping this in the bud by identifying the issues and resolving them. “The capacity of our citizens keeps going down and it is not good for us because our human development index, which education is part of, is not encouraging,’’ he said. On the lack of political will by major stakeholders to help tackle the problem, the lawmaker said while stakeholders’ intervention was necessary, the onus lied on the Federal Government. Hassan called for quick resolution of the ongoing strike to prevent the negative effect of exposing young people to criminality because of idleness.
