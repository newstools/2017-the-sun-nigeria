 From: Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa Acting Governor of Bayelsa State, Rear Admiral Gboribiogha John Jonah (rtd), has decried the attitude of people who drive vehicles without learning how to drive in a recognised driving school, adding that it was risky to do so. He stated this while speaking during the First Graduation Ceremony of the Bayelsa State Driving Academy, run by the state’s Ministry of Transport. Jonah also implored members of the public to patronise the Bayelsa State Driving Academy as it has modern driving equipment, stressing that they would also have the opportunity to be trained as professional drivers, including being taught on how to correctly use road signs and other imperatives on road usage. While assuring the Ministry of Transport that equipment had already been procured but were not functioning optimally but would be repaired and serviced for use, he also advised the management of the academy to continuously sustain it, saying that drivers in government ministries and agencies  should be encouraged to avail themselves of the training opportunities in the Academy to sharpen their driving skills. Jonah also encouraged the graduands to practically utilise the knowledge and skills acquired in the course of  their training in the Academy and maintain safety rules and regulations in accordance with the Federal Road Safety Commission standards. Earlier in his welcome address,  Permanent Secretary , Ministry of Transport, Arch. Ere Efeke, stated that a total of 26 trainees were graduating from the Academy, adding that training activities commenced in the Academy from February this year. He also said that the Academy which was commissioned in 2014 is equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, including a 400 series simulator with 10 cars, a professional 500 series simulator and and three vehicles for training activities, fitted with double pedals in line with Federal Road Safety Commission standard . The permanent secretary also called on the people of the state to embrace the culture of attending approved driving schools, before driving and encourage their wives and children to take driving lessons before driving.
