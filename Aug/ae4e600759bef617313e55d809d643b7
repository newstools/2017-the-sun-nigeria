From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja  Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, Friday, visited President Muhammadu Buhari at Abuja House, London. According to Mr Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, the Archbishop and President Buhari are friends, who share deep respect for each other. He quoted Welby as saying he was delighted to see the rapid recovery President Buhari has made from his health challenges, noting that it was a testimony to the healing powers of God, and answer to prayers of millions of people round the world. He pledged to continue praying for both President Buhari and Nigeria. In his response,  Buhari thanked Archbishop Welby, whom he noted had always stood by him at critical times, and wished him God’s continued grace in his spiritual duty of leading the Anglican Communion worldwide. It will be recalled that when former British Prime Minister, David Cameron described Nigeria as a “fantastically corrupt” country ahead of an anti-corruption summit in London in 2016, Archbishop Welby had retorted: “But this particular President (Buhari) is actually not corrupt.” The Archbishop later personally received the Nigerian President at Lambeth Palace, London, and had also paid a goodwill visit to him in March, during his first medical vacation this year.
