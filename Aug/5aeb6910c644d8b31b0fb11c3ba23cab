From: Paul Osuyi, Asaba A 13-year-old boy, simply identified as Shola, escaped being lynched by an angry mob after he was caught stealing iron rods from a welding workshop. He was caught by the owner of the workshop, one Peter, shortly after successfully stealing the rods at the workshop located on Frank Ailehmen Street, Okumagba Avenue in Warri, Delta State. Peter was said to have raised the alarm which attracted others in the neighbourhood. The gathering mob had already beaten the teenage suspect before he confessed, saying that he wanted to use the rods to build cage for purpose of catching rabbits. He said he was worried that rabbits had taken over the neighborhood and decided to reduce the population of the pest with the cage. Despite his confession, the mob was hell bent on lynching him but the swift intervention of his mother saved the situation. The embattled mother, Aimuh, a native of Ilaje in Ondo State stunned the crowd when she said her son who is an SS 1 student escaped from home at the wee hours of the day. She told the crowd in smattering english that another kid rushed to inform her that Shola has been caught for stealing. She said her husband abandoned her with five children and eloped with another woman. “We have searched everywhere for him (Shola) this morning because he left house very early. I was surprised when another child came in to tell me that my son was caught stealing. “This boy will not kill me. They are five and he is the fourth. Their abandoned them for me and ran away with another woman. Since then, I am the only person taking care of them. Please forgive him,” she appealed. As a result of her plea, the mob freed the teenager with stern warning that the boy should desist from stealing or be ready for the consequences.
