There was uneasy calm, on Tuesday, at Iyana Ipaja area of Lagos State,  as personnel of the Lagos State Task Force clashed with some hoodlums in the area. The face-off was believed to have spilled to the area where the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), is currently holding its orientation camp along old Ipaja-Agege road. It was gathered that the men of the task force, who were also security operatives, arrived the area to raid someone erring motorcycle riders. This was, however, met with resistance as some hoodlums otherwise known as area boys attacked the security operatives while their operation was ongoing. It was gathered that the task force team who were almost overpowered by the hoodlums were said to have called for reinforcement. The arrival of their colleagues soon afterwards led to a melee as the hoodlums began to hurl dangerous weapons at the security operatives. Traders and commuters also scampered for safety when the hoodlums were tear-gassed by the team of mobile policemen who arrived the scene. Meanwhile, some of the hoodlums were also seen just a stone throw from the NYSC orientation camp. Our correspondent who witnessed the incident saw some of the military personnel attached to the camp preventing them from causing commotion near the camp. The soldiers were also seen beating up some of the hoodlums who were caught.
