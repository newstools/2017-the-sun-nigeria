He stated that the command had put in place adequate security measures to ensure
hitch-free Sallah celebration in the state. He added that “the command has deployed its personnel, serviceable vehicles and Force Animals at praying grounds, recreational centres, markets, entry and exit points of the state and other strategic places to ensure hitch-free celebrations. “Covert and overt operatives have been deployed to strategic places to maintain orderliness and ensure peaceful celebration.” The spokesman noted that the command would collaborate with other security agencies to beef up security during the celebration and beyond. He stated that “during the celebrations, people should be extra vigilant by taking good cognisance of people and objects around them, with a view to reporting any suspicious objects or movements to security agencies. “Motorists should strictly obey traffic rules and regulations and avoid reckless, dangerous driving and speeding to minimise cases of accident throughout the festive period and beyond.” Majiya warned parents not to allow underage children to drive as anyone caught would be arrested and prosecuted.(NAN)
