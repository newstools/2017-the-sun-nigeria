Stories By Paul Erewuba Enyimba’s title chase this season was last week given a boost following their their week 32 1-0 victory over Kano Pillars in Calabar their adopted home ground. Tomorrow at the Agege Stadium in Lagos, the People’s Elephant will attempt to consolidate as they face Lagos outfit, Mountain of Fire and Miracles (MFM) who beat relegation-bound Remo Stars 0-1 to maintain their second position on the log with 55 points, having played 32 games with 17 wins and 11 loses. The Aba-based outfit, who surrendered their final chance to revive their title chase at the dying minutes last season, have vowed never to have another repeat. With 50 points in their kitty having played 32 matches, the People’s Elephant who are sitting on  4th position say they are poised to wrestle the first position, if they can win the remaining five matches left of the season. Enyimba attacker Mfon Udoh is already talking tough ahead of the epic encounter. Udoh said although the game against MFM would be tough, they have perfected plans to ensure that victory swings their way. Udoh’s 71st minute strike separated his side from Pillars in the keenly-contested Matchday 32 fixture. “We are determined to give a shot at the title this time around”, he stated. Continuing, he said there was need to consolidate on their last exploit. “We are rearing to go and I believe Lagosians will watch an interesting match.” But MFM Ogunye Austine has dismissed Enyimba;s treat, stressing that the People’s Elephant will fall. Austine’s 71st minute strike was all that the Olukoya Boys needed to beat Remo Stars in  Matchday 32 fixtures of the NPFL clash at Gateway International Stadium, Sagamu.
