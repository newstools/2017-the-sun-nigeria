By Edherigho Efemena It is really sad to see a beautiful lady carrying an unpleasant, smelly and unkempt hair. How often do you wash and condition your hair? How long do you carry a weave, braid or other hairdo? How many times do you expose your hair? Do you scratch every five seconds? There is only one reason this is happening to you: very poor hygiene. Some people do not regularly wash their hair, some carry one weave or hairstyle for four months and this allows for the build-up of dust, dirt and microbes on the hair shaft and scalp. Do you have dandruff? This can not only be caused by poor hygiene but by stress, age, diet, not consuming enough vitamins and fat, certain skin conditions like eczema, scalp ringworm and psoriasis, people with irritated and oily skin and dry skin. Certain hair products and shampoo can also trigger dandruff. On the question of exposure, how many times do you expose your hair to sunlight? Wearing hats, caps and scarves over the head may also be another contributing factor to smelly hair. It could be your environment, climate, living conditions, water quality and air pollution. This is why it is advisable that you regularly wash and properly condition your hair and avoid carrying a hairdo for too long. Practice good hygiene and moisturize the skin and hair. Fragrant haircare products can help mask the offensive odor but may also irritate the scalp thereby worsening the condition in the long run. Try as much as possible to expose the hair to sunlight and air on regular basis. Thorough combing several times a day reduces the chances of infestations, removes excess dirt and helps keep the hair healthy.
