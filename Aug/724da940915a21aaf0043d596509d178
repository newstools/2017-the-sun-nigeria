Other goods confiscated, included three pumping machines, four 33 litres of surface tanks and one white Mercedes Benz at the same mechanic workshop. According to her, the items have been moved to NSCDC exhibition yard in Uyo. She said no arrest was made, adding that the suspects escaped because they were aware that they zxengaged in illegitimate business. Obiagulu reminded the people that operating without approved licence from government was the height of economic sabotage.
