By Zika Bobby Chemical and Allied Products (CAP) Plc, makers of Dulux paint, a subsidiary of UACN Plc, has announced a special price offer line with its 2017 Dulux ‘Let’s Colour’ campaign.
The campaign, which is a global project aimed at adding colours to people’s lives, encourages individuals and communities to paint their homes and surroundings thereby creating a better living environment for everyone.
According to the Marketing Manager, CAP Plc, Mr. Dominic Oladeji, “the Nigerian edition of the ‘Let’s Colour’ campaign was launched in 2012 at the Red Cross Orphanage, Makoko, to localise the global project, thereby creating a colourful experience for the children and staff of the orphanage. Since then, CAP has continued to build platforms for colour interaction with the Dulux brand.”
He said the company has introduced a special price offer on select products to encourage its customers to experience Dulux colours and participate in the campaign.
“At CAP Plc, we consistently explore every opportunity to encourage our customers and our communities to experience the power of colours. We believe that colour has the ability to transform people’s environment as well as their lives, which is why in addition to other activities lined up for the 2017 ‘Let’s Colour’ campaign, we are offering special prices on select products,” Oladeji stated.
“The ‘Let’s Colour’ campaign is one of the many ways CAP Plc, through its premium brand, Dulux, has elevated the concept of colours around the world. We will continue to provide more opportunities and platforms for our customers to experience the power of colour,” he added.
