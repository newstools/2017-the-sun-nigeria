From Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson, has condemned the ongoing controversy between the Nigeria Police Force and Bauchi Senator, Isa Misau. The governor urged both parties to save the police from embarrassment. Misau, representing Bauchi Central senatorial district, had accused the police hierarchy of corruption while the Force alleged that the senator was a deserter, insisting he left service without permission. Dickson, a former police officer, explained that the corruption allegations and counter-allegations between both parties are unhealthy and antithetical to the image of the police institution. Expressed concern about the controversy, the governor said if not checked, it could put the Senate and the police in bad light as well as bring them to public ridicule. He also said the allegations and counter-allegations by the senator and Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, could undermine both parties which the governor described as “critical institutions of state that should remain sacred.” Calling on Misau to withdraw his allegations, he appealed to the police authorities to restrain from making further statements or taking further actions on the senator. Dickson said the police has a lot of problems and needed the support of all, especially serving and former officers, to help motivate men and officers of the force. “Those of us who have passed through the Force have a duty to work with the police to make it strong and better. “Those of us who have been in and out of uniform owe the organisation the support it desires, from people who have had the privilege to serve the police. “On no account should we denigrate the police for what we owe the police is support to enable it overcome the multifarious problems confronting the force, which, in my opinion, is a critical institution of state,” said Dickson.
