By Chinelo Obogo Former minister of aviation, Osita Chidoka has condemned Sunday’s gun attack at St Philips Catholic Church, Ozubulu in Anambra state, which claimed the lives of citizens who were worshipping at the church. He described the attack as sacrilegious and extremely wicked. In solidarity with the victims of the attack, he cancelled all his political engagements scheduled for Sunday and yesterday. Speaking during a condolence visit to the church, he described the attack in the house of God as shocking and particularly strange, adding that all must be done to track down the perpetrators and avenge the death of the innocent worshippers. He said: “This is a very sad day for us all. Those who carried out this evil act have hit us to the bone and at our soft underbelly. They have violated all tenets of our faith and existence as a people. What they have done is a sacrilege and they will never know peace until justice is visited on them and those they conspired with. “We must stand up as a people and say never again. We must rise up in one accord and acclaim our faith, strengthen our resolve to worship without fear, and prayerfully, as a people, march victoriously into a new beginning in our relationship with God. The blood of our innocent brothers and sisters slaughtered today must not go in vain. Our security agencies must therefore do all to track down their killers and produce them to face the law.” He however urged the parishioners to be strong and not allow the attack to deter them as he charged on all citizens of the state to be at alert and join in ensuring that such dastardly act does not reoccur by combining forces with security operatives to bring the perpetrators to book. While praying God to give the bereaved families and the church the fortitude to bear the loss, he also wished the injured a speedy recovery.
