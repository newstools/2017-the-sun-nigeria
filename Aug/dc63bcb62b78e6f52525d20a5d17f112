…Calls for disciplinary action Leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the South-West geo-political region of Nigeria have called for sanctions on Sen. Buruji Kashamu and others who plunged the party into needless crisis confront it. They also warned members against colluding with those who want to destabilise the party not to allow themselves to be used for that purpose. In a communiqué at the end of their meeting, in Ibadan, on Monday, the PDP leaders  also directed the Ogun State chapter of the party to take appropriate steps to punish the embattled senator and others who colluded with him. This is just as Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State has  said that he would declare his presidential ambition openly on October 1 this year. In his opening remarks, Governor Fayose, who is the Chairman of the PDP Governors’ Forum, said the recent judgment of the Supreme Court that recognised Sen. Ahmed Makarfi as the National Chairman of the party,  was a victory for Nigerians as a whole. Governor Fayose also said the second chance given the party by the judgment must not be misused. Said he,  “Our party must take appropriate decisions. We mustn’t allow impunity. We need to save ourselves our else the party may be consumed. We have to confront the monster frontally. We have told our leaders to choose between the monster or us. Take hold and take charge of your state. This guy is a black leg. God has delivered us and we must deliver ourselves. I commend you for your patience during the crisis period. I identify with the Ogun State stakeholders,” he said. The Zonal Chairman of the party, Dr. Eddy Olafeso  thanked members for their support and being identified with the party in spite of all odds.
