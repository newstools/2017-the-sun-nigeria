Diamond Bank Plc has set the stage for the selection, training and empowerment of 50 entrepreneurs in the 7th edition of its Building Entrepreneurs Today (BET) initiative. This initiative, which is in partnership with the Enterprise Development Center (EDC) of the Pan Atlantic University, is at the core of the bank’s corporate social responsibility strategy, and is aimed at creating a new generation of entrepreneurs who will not be overwhelmed by the challenges posed by the harsh operating business environment but will, with the training and seed capital from the bank, provide the needed value to the economy. According to the bank, the BET initiative is in line with its strategic quest to ensure that entrepreneurs in the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are properly trained, equipped with up-to-date business knowledge and given enough capital to effectively play in the economy, adding that the 50 entrepreneurs that will be selected for the six months entrepreneurial training programme would be those whose businesses have the potential to stimulate sustainable economic growth and development in Nigeria. The Head of Corporate Communications, Chioma Afe, said in a statement made available to the press that the BET programme is part of the bank’s decision to give back to its community by supporting human capital development in Nigeria, pointing out that as the backbone of a healthy productive economy, entrepreneurs in the MSME sector need proper and up-to-date knowledge of how to run a business successfully in an inclement environment. She said: “Diamond Bank believes that empowering entrepreneurs will contribute to the economy and boost production and employment. These inform our passion to drive the training of entrepreneurs at the MSME sector and ensure that they are empowered with the knowledge to succeed and build sustainable businesses. By helping them to build capacity and providing them with seed capital, it is obvious that their chances of survival will be higher and they will be better positioned to continue to contribute to the GDP.” Afe said the theme for the training season is “Innovation and Social Impact”, adding that the training will focus on entrepreneurs in all sectors of the economy with entries expected from all the geographical zones in Nigeria. function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
