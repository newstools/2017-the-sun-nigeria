By Chidera Akalonu Ahead of next month’s crucial World Cup qualifiers against Cameroon Super Eagles captain John Obi Mikel has returned to action for the first time in four months as he started for Tianjin Teda in a Chinese Super League clash against Hebei. The midfielder  who has been out with an abdominal injury, which needed surgery in London has finally recovered from injury and lasted the distance in Tianjin Teda’s 2-0 loss to Hebei CFFC in the Chinese Super League on Monday afternoon. However, it will represent a massive boost for the Super Eagles, ahead of next month’s crucial World Cup qualifiers against Cameroon. In his absence, Tianjin Teda are in relegation troubles after winning only two games from a possible seventeen, while the Super Eagles were beaten 2-0 by South Africa in an African Cup of Nations qualifier. He has not played for Nigeria this year with his last game being the 3-1 home win over Algeria in November 2016. And barring any unforeseen situation, the 30-year old will therefore be in the running to be picked on the squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Cameroon. Nigeria host the African champions on September 1 in Uyo with the return leg in Yaounde three days later. Super Eagles manager Gernot Rohr is expected to announce his roster for the World Cup qualifier against the African champions this week.
