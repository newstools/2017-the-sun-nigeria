By Chinelo Obogo Former aviation minister and governorship aspirant on the platform of the United Progressive Party (UPP),  Osita Chidoka, has resumed the commissioning of his campaign offices and tours of all the electoral wards across the state. Chidoka who has since set up campaign offices in all the 21 local government areas across the state, out of which he has already toured and commissioned 12, announced that the remaining tours are dedicated to victims of the gun attack at St. Philips Catholic Church Ozubulu, Anambra state. While commissioning his campaign office in Atani, Ogbaru Local Government, he led his supporters in prayers to honour the victims of the attack, saying that their suffering and death must not be in vain. He urged all citizens of Anambra to stand up in unity against impunity and recklessness. He lamented the dearth of amenities in the Ogbaru area despite the rich natural resources while saying that the election offers the people of Anambra the opportunity to institute a responsible and resourceful government that dedicates its energies to the good of the people. He said: “The level of government neglect here is very alarming. The failure of the government to open up the economic potentials of Ogbaru is unexplainable. Ogbaru is blessed with huge gas deposits, fertile land for agricultural activities, abundant aquatic resources and a waterway that connects the inland of our state to the rest of the world, yet we have done nothing to develop the resources for the benefit of our people. Clearly the people of Ogbaru have not been treated well”. He said if elected, his government will set up a special development programme to unlock the economic potentials of Ogbaru and other such areas across the state.
