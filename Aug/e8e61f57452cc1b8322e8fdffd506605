Princess Diana’s sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, plan to honour their late mother on Wednesday to mark the 20th anniversary of her death. The princes are scheduled to meet representatives of charities supported by Diana at Kensington Gardens, the grounds outside the palace where she lived with her sons and former husband, Prince Charles. William, 35, and Harry, 32, will “pay tribute to the life and work of their mother” and meet people from charities including London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital, the National Aids Trust, the Leprosy Mission, and the English National Ballet. They will meet a palace gardener befriended by Diana at a temporary White Garden created to mark the anniversary, the royal family said. “Together they will reflect on the significant achievements of the princess, and the legacy of her work which continues to resonate with so many today,” it said. Ahead of the event, William and Harry gave candid interviews to British broadcasters about Diana and the impact on their childhood of her death in a Paris car crash on Aug. 31, 1997. The British public reacted to Diana’s death with a huge outpouring of grief, while tabloid media published lurid, unsubstantiated claims that her death might have been orchestrated by senior royals or other members of the British establishment.
