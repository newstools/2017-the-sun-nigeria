Nigerian forward, Victor Moses is happy to have spent five years as a Chelsea player.
Last week marked the fifth anniversary of Moses joining and he is fulfilled to be a key player for the Premier League champions, who have sent him out on loan thrice: to Liverpool, Stoke and West Ham.
“It does feel like yesterday to be honest,” Moses, who joined from Wigan in 2012, told Chelsea’s official website on Sunday.
“I am glad to still be here and I am enjoying every single bit of my football at the moment. I just want to keep on going. The most important thing is helping my team-mates when we are on the pitch and make sure we win as many games as we can. This season is going to be a very difficult season but we have to do the best to make sure everyone is happy, the fans, the club, everyone.”
Chelsea faced Everton at Stamford Bridge on Sunday in what was Moses’ first home match of the season after he missed the 3-2 Premier League defeat to Burnley through suspension.
“It is always nice to start the home season, the first game at Stamford Bridge for me, and it will be nice to get three points,” he added.
