Veteran comic, Baba Sala is not dead after all. This was disclosed by his son, Yemi, after new rumours of his death began to circulate. Yemi maintained that the 82-year-old Moses Olaiya is alive. ‘It’s not true. I still spoke to him this morning. This man you’re talking about is my biological father and it’s painful that this kind of thing goes on every time. At least Nigerian journalists should reach out to the family before publishing such stories. Baba Sala is fine and I, his son still spoke to him today.’ Moses Olaiya is widely regarded as one of Nigeria’s most dynamic entertainers, with a career that spans comedy, drama and music.
