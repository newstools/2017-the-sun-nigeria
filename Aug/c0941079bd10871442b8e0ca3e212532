Andy Murray has withdrawn from this week’s Rogers Cup in Canada, paving the way for Spain’s Rafael Nadal to become world number one. The Briton has pulled out of the event, due to be held at the Uniprix Stadium in Montreal, because of the ongoing hip issue which marred his recent Wimbledon campaign. His withdrawal meant he could now lose his place at the top of the world rankings to Nadal, who only needs to reach the semi-finals in Canada to take over at the summit of world tennis. Double Wimbledon and Olympic champion, Sir Andy also remains a doubt for the US Open, which begins on August 28 in New York City. “I am sad to be missing the tournament in Montreal because I have many great memories from my time in Canada,” Murray said in a statement released by Tennis Canada. “I am doing everything I can to return as quickly as possible.” Other notable names have also withdrawn from Montreal including Croatia’s Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic, who is still suffering from an abductor injury. Three-time grand slam champion Stan Wawrinka has also been ruled out for the remainder of the 2017 season because of a knee injury, joining Serbia’s defending champion and 12-time grand slam winner Novak Djokovic on the sidelines. function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
