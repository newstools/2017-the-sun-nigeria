Security operatives, on Tuesday, clamped down on protesters who are demanding immediate resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari if he could resume office.
Music icon and pro-democracy activist, Charles Oputa (popularly known as Charly Boy) was among the protesters injured. Charly Boy reportedly sustained a cut on his face following a confrontation with police officials. He said a mobile police officer hit his face with the butt of his gun. The police, however, denied the claim. Security agents comprising military police, officials of the Department Security Service (DSS) and other paramilitary personnel numbering over 500 have taken over Unity Fountain, Abuja, venue of the protest. No civilian was allowed access to the place.
