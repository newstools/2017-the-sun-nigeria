From Fred Itua, Abuja Prof. Akolisa Ufodike, a governorship aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has announced that he is dropping out of the race so that he can work with whoever will emerge as candidate to ensure victory for the party. He released a statement where he indicated his withdrawal and expressed optimism that the party will be able to oust the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) from power in the state. The statement reads: “I will be ending my race to become my party’s standard bearer in the forthcoming election. The last few months have been the most exciting of my life. I traversed the state and learned firsthand from people what the issues affecting their lives were. “I also spent a significant amount of time discussing my candidacy within party ranks. My conversation with potential delegates made it clear that they believe that it is crucial for is to be extremely competitive in Anambra North Senatorial zone in order for us to be successful in the elections. I will support the candidate that emerges as the choice of our party delegates and I implore others in the race to do so once it is concluded decisively. This is not the time to split ranks if we are to defeat Governor Willie Obiano. “We recognise that commercial activity and every other element in our society depends on how our people feel about their safety, therefore, the PDP will ensure that security returns to the state. We will revive education and give our youth the foundation they need to be successful” Ufodike said.
