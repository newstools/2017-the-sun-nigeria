Iran’s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday dismissed a recent annual report by the U.S. government on the lack of religious freedom in the Islamic republic. The Foreign Ministry Spokesperson, Bahram Qasemi, said that the U.S. Department of State’s report was “unrealistic, baseless and biased’’. Qasemi also said that the document had been prepared to serve only political purposes, according to reports. He said the report was “undoubtedly unacceptable,’’ presenting “once again, a distorted image of the status of religious freedom’’ in Iran with wrong allegations. Qasemi hit back at the U.S. government with what he called “the U.S. dark record of racial and religious discrimination, Islamophobia and xenophobia, as well as violent attacks and police brutality against Muslims.’’ He suggested that the U.S. government took legal and practical measures to protect religious freedom itself, and particularly make sure that Muslims’ rights were respected in the United States, instead of judging the status of religious freedom in other countries.
