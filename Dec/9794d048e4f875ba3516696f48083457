…Says, New order is to prevent crimes, criminality during Yuletide From Molly Kilete, Abuja Barely 24, hours after Inspector General of Police (IGP), Ibrahim Idris, ordered operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), not to operate on the nation’s highways and roads, he has reversed the order and directed that stop-and-search operations be resumed. Idris, who gave the new order yesterday night, said the directive was intended to prevent crimes and criminality throughout the Christmas and New Year festivals as some criminals may want to seize the opportunity of the earlier announced stoppage of stop-and-search operations to perpetrate evil acts. He said to ensure a free flow of traffic and ease movement of travelers, the stop and search operations would not be located at areas susceptible to traffic gridlock or vehicular hold-ups, adding that traffic police personnel would be deployed to such points and sections to manage traffic and carry out police observation duties. The IGP, who gave the order in a statement, signed by the Force Public Relations Officer, Moshood Jimoh, said the IGP further directed all state Commissioners of Police to supervise their personnel deployed on the operation to ensure that their locations were not turned into roadblocks, as the total ban on all forms of road blocks is still in force.
