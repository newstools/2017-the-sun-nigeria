 Following its launch earlier in the year in Lagos and Dubai, OROS, an international perfume brand has unveiled actress, Juliet Ibrahim and her boyfriend, Iceberg Slim, as its brand ambassadors. Commenting, an excited Juliet said: “This is a season of love and being in love with Iceberg Slim is a perfect thing for me, hence, the perfume is also a perfect gift for lovers.” A statement from the platform stated that the pair are a perfect match and will exude the vision of the perfume brand in Africa. OROS comes in seven different scents; four for women, one unisex and two for men. The fragrance is described as elegant, provocative and free spirited, a scent full of passion and emotion. Earlier in August, Juliet had confirmed her relationship with the Nigerian artiste in a lovely message on his birthday. The duo also went as far as getting matching tattoos while vacating in the US.
