Real Madrid became the first team to win back-to-back Club World Cup titles as Cristiano Ronaldo’s second-half free-kick beat Brazilian side Gremio. Zinedine Zidane’s side dominated from the start but found chances difficult against well-organised opposition. But Ronaldo got the breakthrough with a well-struck effort from 25 yards. It is a record-equalling third Club World Cup win for Real, who also triumphed in 2014, matching Barcelona’s achievement.
