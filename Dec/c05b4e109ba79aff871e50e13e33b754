Arye Ayiiteh, contender for the West African Boxing Union (WABU) middleweight title, has vowed to dethrone reigning champion, Nigeria’s Abolaji “Afonja Warrior” Rasheed, when they meet at GOtv Boxing Night 13 on 26 December. The event, which will feature musical performances by Small Doctor, Simi, Falz and Reekado Banks, will witness seven bouts. Speaking from his Accra base on Sunday, Ayiitey said he is familiar with Afonja’s style, having watched him fight at various editions of GOtv Boxing Night. “He holds no surprises for me. I’ve seen him fight on many occasions and can confidently say he is not as good as me. I am going to Ghana with the belt. Ghana has always been ahead of Nigeria in sports,” he bragged.          The biggest fight on the night will see Nigeria’s Oto “Joe Boy” Joseph take on Abdulrahim Ahmed of Egypt for the vacant African Boxing Union (ABU) lightweight title. Olaide “Fijaborn” Fijabi will also fight for the ABU light welterweight title against Michael “Tyson” Odhiambo of Kenya. Also in the welterweight category, Rilwan “Baby Face” Babatunde will take on Chijioke “Painless” Nigige for the vacant national title. The lighweight division will see Rilwan “Real One” Oladosu go up against Kehinde “Ijoba” Badmus, while Jimoh “Hogan Jnr.” Lukman will fight Rilwan “Scorpion” Opatola. In the middleweight division, Matthew “Wizeman” Obinna will fight David “Cosmos”Awosika in a challenge bout.
