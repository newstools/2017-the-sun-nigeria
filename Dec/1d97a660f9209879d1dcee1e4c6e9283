Tiger Woods made a successful return with a t-9 finish at the Hero World Challenge earlier this month, and it appears he’s picked his next tournament. According to Golfweek.com, Woods will play the Genesis Open, Feb. 15-18 at Riviera Country Club in California. Woods fired three out of four rounds in the 60s in the Bahamas while making his first start since withdrawing from the Omega Dubai Desert Classic in February. He has undergone four back surgeries since 2014. Woods projects to have a light schedule before the 2018 Masters. He has not played in a major championship since 2015, and has not won one since defeating Rocco Mediate in an 18-hole playoff at the 2008 U.S. Open. The Tiger Woods Foundation serves as the Genesis Open host organization.
