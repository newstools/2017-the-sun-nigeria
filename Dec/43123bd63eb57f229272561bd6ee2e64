FROM: JOE EFFIONG, Uyo The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has claimed victory in today’s local government election in Akwa Ibom State even before polling. The party, in response to the allegation of colluding with the Akwa Ibom State Independent Electoral Commission (AKISIEC) to rig PDP to victory, hit back, saying its accuser, the All Progressives Congress (APC), has merely admitted failure due to unpreparedness. The state Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Ini Ememobong, told Saturday Sun that the PDP had already worked for its victory even before now. “I hear a lot of APC chieftains say that they will flood the state with security; and my answer to that is; ‘if you succeeded in Anambra, you will succeed here. If you come with army, be ready to kill everybody. We will become human shield” Ememobong said APC cannot take the polls results from the backdoor because it has neither campaigned nor supported the holding of the election, rather it was busy trying to frustrate us with litigations “Those who fail to prepare, prepare to fail. That is why the PDP has shown this level of seriousness in its preparation. We selected people of high capacity and credibility. Our candidates are A-class materials. We know PDP will win, but the people we select must affect the fortunes of the people. Almost every chairmanship candidate for PDP can contest for governorship. “We have already won the election. That’s an open secret. How do we win?  We win by the crowd you saw for the flag off. So it is true that we have won. We are only going for affirmation. We are going to affirm the crowd you saw at the flag off. We are going to affirm the crowd you met at the 31 local government areas. Election is over because election is a choice. What is happening is the predominant choice of the people of Akwa Ibom State,” he said.
