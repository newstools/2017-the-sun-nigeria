By WILLY EYA A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Centre for Reform Education Initiative (CREI) has urged the Independent National Electoral  Commission (INEC) and critics of Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State to leave him alone to concentrate on the good work he is doing in the state. Executive Director of CREI, Chinwe Ugwu, who gave the advice in a  statement made available to Saturday Sun, said it was clear that mischief makers were at work and bent on distracting the governor from fulfilling his laudable  programmes in the state. She said that at the appropriate time, the truth about the double registration allegations against the governor will be unveiled and those crucifying him will be put to shame. The statement read in part: “As a developmental organisation, CREI has viewed with serious  concerns insinuations and lies being peddled against His Excellency,  Governor Yahaya Bello all with the intent of distracting his attention  from the serious business of governance. “We appeal those who have already  convicted the Governor out of malice and are busy crucifying his  character and smearing his name for political reasons to stop their  mischievous plans.” She said that most of those  passing judgment against the governor are doing so out of ignorance  and malice. The CREI boss advised INEC not to play into the hands of politicians who are  looking for every opportunity to score cheap points against the  governor because of his anti-corruption stance. Ugwu also called on the people of Kogi state to continue to  support the governor to deliver dividends of democracy to them.
