From: Linus Oota, Lafia Deputy Governor of Nasarawa State, Hon. Silas Ali Agara, has explained that Governor Umaru Tanko Al-makura has not endorsed his aspiration to succeed him as the next governor of the state come 2019. Agara said that he is presently undertaking wide range consultations with All Progressives Congress (APC) stakeholders with the hope of aspiring to be the party’s governorship candidate in the 2019 elections in the state, adding that the governor is not interested in imposing any candidate on the people. The deputy governor, who spoke through his media assistant, Godspower Ede, debunked media reports alleging that Governor Al-makura had endorsed his aspiration to contest the 2019 governorship election in the state. According to him, “the governor has never given such ‘nod’ or endorsement to his deputy to succeed him and such insinuation should be dismissed as a figment of the writers imagination “The governor as the father of the entire APC members in the state, including the deputy governor appreciates the aspirations of some APC members to succeed him and treats them equally without giving any slightest hint of having a favourite. “Knowing the antecedents of the Governor as a champion of the promotion of the rule of law and due process, the deputy governor is at his wits end as to the origin and intentions of the writer” he said This reaction is coming on the heels of a publication in the Leadership Newspaper edition of 18th December 2017 on page 12 with a caption ‘2019: Almakura Gives Nod to Deputy’. He said that the deputy governor would have ignored the publication but for the damage the report is capable of doing to the excellent relationship existing between him and his hardworking principal and other aspirants.
