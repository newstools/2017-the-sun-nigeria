The board members of the Nigeria Basketball Federation have lauded the recent appointment of its President Engineer Musa Kida as the Vice Chairman of the Nigeria House Project Committee which was recently reconstituted. Speaking on behalf of the members, NBBF Vice President, Babs Ogunade said the recent appointment was a direct recognition of Kida’s effort since he was sworn in as the NBBF president. “This is not just another recognition for our president, it is a significant landmark which confirmed our firm belief and confidence in his ability to change the narratives of basketball in Nigeria before we unanimously voted for him to lead the federation.” The Executive board of the NBBF is confident that Kida will bring his international wealth of experience and goodwill to bear while serving as the Vice Chairman of the committee saddled with the responsibility of promoting the image of Nigeria through culture, economic opportunities and tourism during the Commonwealth Games, the 2018 FIFA World Cup as well as the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. “It is evident that our amiable President has demonstrated enough ability to make an impact in whatever responsibility he is given. The victories of Nigeria at the international stage, the improved global recognition and series of awards already won by the federation in the last 4 months are testimonies to what Kida can achieve under the right atmosphere.”
