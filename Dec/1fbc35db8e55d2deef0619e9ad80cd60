Drivers and passengers are already feeling the heat occasioned by the scarcity of the product as many drivers could not get petrol. The product, Daily Sun gathered, was unavailable in most of the filling stations in Akure, Ondo, Ore and Igbara-oke, at the time of filling this report yesterday, while few stations that had fuel sold between N170 and N180 per litre. Further findings revealed that most of the filling stations were hoarding the product, thereby, causing undue hardship for car owners in many parts of the state. Also, a long queue was noticed in the few filling stations that sold at the official N145 pump price, while most of the stations were under lock. The development has adversely affected social and commercial activities in the state as many people find it difficult move around due to the fuel scarcity. However, the state government has set up a task force to ensure all petroleum dealers in the state sell the product at the official pump price. The task force also moved round the state to ensure no petroleum dealer hoarded the product and, also, to ensure filling stations were opened to customers. The task force, led by the Special Adviser to the governor on Special Duties, reportedly moved round filling stations in Ore, Ondo, Okitipupa, Akungba Akoko and Akure to ensure strict compliance to governmentâ€™s directive on the sale of petrol in the state. The government also threatened to close down any filling station selling above the official pump price.
