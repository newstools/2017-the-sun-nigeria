Some of the tennis players taking part in the ongoing Rainoil Tennis Open at the Lagos Country Club, Ikeja, have expressed delight over the experience gained on the Clay Courts at the venue.
Thomas Otu who eased past Ismaila Sikiru 6-1, 6-4 to move to the second round said it was a good development by the sponsors. “Clay has a way of helping us to further develop our skills. I am happy to play on it and the experience is good,” Otu said. Sylvester Emmanuel who is on a three-year $90, 000 sponsorship by Rainoil to the Pere Riba Tennis Academy in Spain, was also elated about the turf.
“I am used to all the surfaces in tennis but it’s good to know that the sponsors decided on clay. It also means the sponsors are working for the progress of tennis,” Emmanuel said. Junior champion, Christopher Bulus, stressed that he enjoyed the clay experience for a change.
“Most tournaments in the country are on hard surface but I am happy to be at the Rainoil event and compete on Clay for a change.
It is part of the development of every player,” Bulus said. Micheal Osewa, another junior international who came from a set down to upset Ikechukwu Iloputa 0-6, 6-2, 6-4 in the first round of the tournaments said Clay is a good turf for young players.
“I am enjoying the tournament especially because of the surface. It will be nice to have more clay court competitions in the country to help us develop better,” he said.
