Oluwatomisin Sanni, aka Tommy Rosiers, has joined the fast growing record company, Panoramic Records, owned by millennial innovator and creative director, Noah Miller, as part of its social marketing and brand communications’ team. Born in Canada, Tommy Rosiers is the son of erudite politician and businessman, Chief Oluwafemi Sanni, MD/CEO, Stefolga Group. Tommy Rosiers, who has featured on music news outlets such as BET, Shaderoom, Baller Alert and Linda Ikeji’s Blog, has amassed large media attention, interest and clientele, to help build Panoramic Records. Noah Miller was recently featured on Forbes. Panoramic Records is the first millennial-run label with intentions to break the regular stereotypes of industry labels. The online-based record company allows artistes, producers and creative people to submit their works directly to the record company, for the A&R team to review and give feedback. “With the introduction of the internet, the music industry has become so much more vast and the number one problem artistes of today face is having a proper team around them, to help them with branding, content amplification, and marketing strategy. This is why many artistes contact record labels, but after a while, artistes and producers get used to opening emails and receiving no replies from labels. “However, at Panoramic Records, we are changing that. It’s free of charge to submit your music for our team’s review and feedback. If we see a potential fit into our label, we sit down with the artiste and producer and discuss opportunities for his or her future. Even if we feel the potential isn’t there yet, our team may offer some indirect opportunities through our agency branch,” Tommy Rosiers said. Launched November 28, the label is already making rumbles in the music industry. It has acquired five up and coming artistes who already have accumulated millions of streams on major music streaming platforms.
