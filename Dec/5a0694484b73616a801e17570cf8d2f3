The Federal Government on Sunday assured that adequate security measures have been adopted to thwart any terror attack on the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and elsewhere around the country. A statement by Segun Adeyemi, Special Adviser to the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said “there is no cause for alarm despite the latest travel advisories by some Western countries”. ”We know that the terrorists, who have been massively degraded and put on the run, have been looking for soft targets to attack. “This is the nature of terrorism all over the world, as can be seen in recent attacks in the UK, France and Egypt, among others. ”That is why the Nigerian security agencies have continued to be on
the alert, even if their efforts have been largely unobtrusive so as not to disrupt the daily activities of the citizenry. ”Such efforts are routinely stepped up during religious festivals,” he said. Mohamned said the Federal Government would continue to take adequate measures to protect the lives and properties of citizens and non-citizens alike. He reiterated that the military remained unrelenting in ensuring that the terrorists neither regrouped nor regain the capacity to carry out organized attacks. He said the Federal Government’s sensitization campaign on security, with the punchline ”if you see something, say something”, would be stepped up on national radio and television. The Minister advised the citizens to be security conscious and to report suspicious people and objects
to the security agencies. (Source: NAN)
