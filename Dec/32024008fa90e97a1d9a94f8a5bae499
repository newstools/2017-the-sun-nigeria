As part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to deepen the usage of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), popularly called cooking gas, NIPCO Plc has donated LPG accessories to public school administrators under Apapa Local Education Authority.
Managing Director of NIPCO Plc, Mr.Sanjay Teotia, while presenting the accessories which included gas cylinders and burners to the administrators and head teachers expressed the company’s readiness to partner with the Federal Government in improving access to LPG as cooking fuel for the generality of Nigerians at affordable rates.
Sanjay noted that this is not the first time the company was presenting free gas accessories to Nigerians, stressing that the Auchi community in Edo State had equally benefitted from the company’s CSR initiative in the past.
The MD also hinted that more efforts would be made in the area of skills deployment to its retail outlets across the country in a bid to facilitate cooking gas access to Nigerians in line with the Federal Governments National Gas Policy. He explained that, with the technical commissioning of the LPG plant in NIPCO’s terminal at Apapa, the company is poised for more seamless operation in the storage and distribution of cooking gas across the nooks and crannies of the country. According to him, cooking gas is safe and economical to use compared to other domestic cooking fuel, adding that safety has remained a cardinal principle of the organisation at any point in the storage and distribution of gas at its LPG plant.
One of the beneficiaries,  Olayinka Emmanuel, said the donation is a commendable one, stressing that the company has performed wonderfully well despite its short period of existence.
