He maintained that the Board will continue to run its financial and other activities with transparency and accountability, even as it prepares for 2018 exercise. The JAMB boss told COESU officials who complained of low academic-performing students in Colleges of Education that it is not the fault of the board but the choice of the candidates. He said: “Applicants are always allowed to choose colleges of education as first choice institutions in admission forms. “But, most of them prefer to choose universities because the O’ level five credits requirement for admission into higher institutions is uniform.” COESU National President, Nuhu Ogirima, in his remarks, stressed that the admission system does not augur well for the teacher education system, especially at the colleges of education level. He solicited the support of the board for the six-man committee that was constituted to review admission requirements for colleges of education.
