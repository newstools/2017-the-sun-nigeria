By Chidera Akalonu As far as Anderlecht striker Henry Onyekuru is concerned, he still has a chance of making Nigeria’s World Cup roster despite suffering a serious injury against Eupen in the Belgian First Division A on Friday. Onyekuru was forced out of the clash against former club KAS Eupen on Friday after he collided with the opposing goalkeeper. The Nigeria international will undergo knee surgery after suffering a ligament injury and speculation is rife that he would be out of action for the rest of this season, but Onyekuru is having none of it.  The Everton loanee took to the social networks to provide a very positive update about his injury. Henry stated : ‘’What a great year it has been for me, thank you to everyone that has supported me, especially the Almighty God. ‘’I hope to return back to fitness soon and will be back fitter and stronger in the new year.’’ Henry Onyekuru has won two caps for the Super Eagles since making his maiden appearance against Togo in June. Onyekuru joined Everton from Eupen at the beginning of the season but was immediately loaned out to Anderlecht where he has overcome a slow start to hit good form. He has scored a total of nine goals thus far and was hoping such form will help him stake a claim for a place at next year’s World Cup with Nigeria. Friday night’s win kept Anderlecht in third place in the Belgian top flight table with 37 points from 20 matches, 13 points adrift of leaders Club Brugge. Chaleroi are second with 39 points. Of all the players in Nigeria’s pool for the World Cup, only Hapoel Beer Sheva’s Anthony Nwakaeme (11) has scored more goals than Onyekuru (10) in the current season, and the Belgian League has a higher club coefficient than Israel.
