By Zika Bobby Grand Oak spirit brand, Lord’s Gin was on ground at the second edition of Nigeria’s premier and white collar boxing event ‘Rumble on the Atlantic Season 2.0’. The event with the theme “Work, Train, Play” was put together by Elitebox and sponsored by Lord’s Gin. The Boxing fiesta enabled recreational boxers who are mostly top executives in their various professional fields to keep fit as well as entertain boxing lovers to a night of fun and excitement with several boxing bouts set upon the picturesque backdrop of the Atlantic Ocean in Lagos. Brand Manager, Adebowale Bojuwade, said  the company’s sponsorship of the event was part of its consumer engagement initiatives and its readiness to promote sports business in the country. “Rumble on the Atlantic is one event that has come to stay and Lord’s Gin was part of it last year just as the brand is currently doing right now because we believe in this event. Our support for this event goes beyond just coming around to entertain people and making them have a feel of our gin brand. Our aim is to drive an engagement that will win the consumers’ loyalty to the brand”, he said. Founder, Elitebox Fitness, Rehia Giwa-Osagie commended Lord’s Gin for the partnership, saying: “If you look at a lot of these fighters, they are all recreational boxers. Recreational boxing means that they box to keep fit. They don’t box to fight professionally, that is what recreational boxing means and that is what Rumble on the Atlantic event is all about”.
