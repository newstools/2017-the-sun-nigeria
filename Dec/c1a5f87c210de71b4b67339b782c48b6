From Joe Effiong, Uyo To mark the end of the year and usher in 2018, on December 26 and December 27, all roads will lead to Akwa Ibom State for the maiden edition of Ukap’isuam Cultural Carnival to mark the end of 2017 and usher in 2018. Packaged by the Akwa Ibim State government, the two-day event tagged End Slavery is packaged by the Akwa Ibom State Ministry of Culture & Tourism to jump start tourism as the main stay of the state’s economy. Speaking, Victor Anti, the State Commissioner for Culture & Tourism said that some of the artistes performing are Wizkid, Teckno, Tuface, Run Town and Tiwa Savage. He said: “It is one of the cardinal objectives to this administration and the vision of the governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel, to make sure Akwa Ibom is a strong destination brand worldwide; where people can come and enjoy a secure and relaxed  atmosphere and experience the hospitality that Akwa Ibom has to give to the world. Ukap’isua is simply a celebration of who we are and what Akwa Ibom has to offer the entire world.” Antai says each of the bands where the musicians would be assigned would have a name linked to cultural location in the state among others.
