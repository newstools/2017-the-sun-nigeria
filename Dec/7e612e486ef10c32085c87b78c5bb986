Nurses have been advised to empathise with women suffering endometriosis and infertility, as their cases are peculiar.
Speaking the two-day second annual Amuwo Odofin Nurses Scientific Conference in Lagos, which held in on from November 22-23, 2017, Mrs Olivia Nwankudu, the founder of EndoSurvivors International Foundation, said there was need for the nurses to give women dealing with endometriosis and infertility needed attention since they have no control over their condition.
According to him, much have been said and done about malaria, HIV, diabetes and some other well-prevented and effectively treated diseases, but “empathy should be shown to girls and women burdened with the most debilitating pain, a disease whose sufferers have absolutely no control over, as regards how it comes upon them.”
Expounded on endometriosis, a condition resulting from the appearance of endometrial tissue outside the womb and causing pelvic pain, especially associated with menstruation, Nwankudu said severe menstrual pain, for instance, “interferes with a girl/woman’s life, adding: “The beginning of a journey is diagnosis, for women to seek treatment when they observe abnormalities.”
She asked nurses to continually educate themselves, so as to provide counselling to girls/women suffering endometriosis. Also speaking at the event, Mrs Faosat Olaide Animashaun, director of Nursing Services (DNS) of the Lagos State Health Service Commission, said training was important for nurses “to help them with excellent healthcare delivery, even at the secondary care level.”
According to her, “continued education is a hallmark for improvement in the nursing profession.” The two-day nurses conference,which took place at the Amuwo Odofin Maternal and Child Centre (MCC), had over 150 nurses in attendance.
