Ahead of the Christmas and New Year celebrations, and based on the security alert by the UK and United States Embassies, we, the Luxury Bus Owners Association of Nigeria advise bus operators to maintain a high level of security consciousness during and after the yuletide, especially in the Federal Capital Abuja and other states.
In a press statement by our President, Prince (Hon.) Emeka Mamah, we advise bus passengers to remain vigilant and cooperate with the various bus companies towards ensuring the safety of lives and property at the various motor parks.
The association also advises bus passengers to report any suspicious movements or characters to the law enforcement agencies.
The luxury bus operators association will liaise with the Nigerian Police and various security agencies to ensure the protection of lives and property, and we reassure all bus passengers that their comfort and safety are our top priority.
We also appeal to the Lagos State government to revisit the policy of relocating luxury bus companies from their loading points.
This is because the affected companies built their Jibowu loading points with bank loans, and the policy of clustering them in a particular place will not only hurt their businesses but jeopardise the repayment of the bank loans. Prince Emeka Mamah,
Luxury Bus Owners
Association of Nigeria
