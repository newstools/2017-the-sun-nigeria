Though, Yusuf was not forthcoming on the nature of Ogor’s ailment, he assured that there is no cause for alarm as regards the health of the caucus leader. According to him, Ogor is recuperating and will soon be back and take his seat in the Green Chamber. “That news on Ogor’s state of health is not news at all. But he is getting better now. What has happened to him is not stroke, I’m not aware that it’s stroke. He took ill and was taken to the hospital and I have spoken to him three days ago”, Yusuf said. Ogor was reported in the media to have suffered partial paralysis and is hospitalized in Switzerland, has been absent at the House sittings.
