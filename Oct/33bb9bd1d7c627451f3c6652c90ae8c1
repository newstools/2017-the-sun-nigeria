By Bunmi Ogunyale Super Eagles’ camp in Uyo last night came alive, as skipper John Obi Mikel led 14 other players to the Le Meridian Ibom Hotel ahead of this weekend’s World Cup qualifying tie against Zambia. Monday’s arrivals also included Mikel Agu, Williams Troost Ekong, Leon Balogun, Ahmed Musa, Shehu Abdullahi, Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheancho. Others are Dele Ajiboye, Elderson Echiejile, John Ogu, Anthony Nwakaeme, Oghenekaro Etebo and Ikechukwu Ezenwa. Arsenal winger, Alex Iwobi and other players were expected to join the team today, before their first training session at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium. Mikel said: “We are taking this game very serious. We must wrap this race up on Saturday. Our team has shown professionalism, dedication and determination to be in this position.” Nigeria leads Group B with 10 points from four matches and they will advance to next year’s mundial if they beat Zambia in Uyo on Saturday.
