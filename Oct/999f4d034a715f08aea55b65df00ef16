By Ighodalo Isiramen Nigeria’s squash player, Yemisi Olatunji has tasked the Ministry of Youth and Sports to support squash development in the country. In a chat with Daily Sun Sports recently, Olatunji craved for the need to provide an enabling environment that would see the game grow in order to win laurels and also put the country’s name on the world map. Her words: “I feel very proud donning Nigeria’s colours at any international meet and I believe we can bring more glory to the country if more attention is given to the sport. “I strongly believe Nigeria can make exploits in the game if it is properly funded and monitored by our administrators. I’m sure squash as an elite sport can re-write the country’s name in gold if the budding talents are properly harnessed.” Daily Sun Sports checks revealed Olatunji is currently ranked 207 in the world.
