His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, on Monday, ordered three further airlifts of relief supplies to Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. In early October, Sheikh Mohammed ordered the creation of an open air bridge from Dubai to Bangladesh to send relief material to the refugees. The aid effort has so far seen six airlifts of crucial relief supplies to Dhaka in Bangladesh. The air bridge operated flights on 2nd, 11th, 13th and 15th of October, apart from two airlifts conducted previously on 12th and 26th September, 2017. The six shipments of the air bridge have transported a total of over 550 metric tons of relief material worth US$ 2,308,600 (Dh8,479,718). Dispatched relief items have come from participating aid agencies including UNHCR, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, IFRC, Medecins Sans Frontieres, MSF, Emirates Red Crescent, and the UNHRD partners, International Organisation for Migration, IOM, World Health Organisation, WHO, Solidarites International, and Shelter Box. The aid materials include food, family tents, tarpaulins, mosquito nets, sleeping mats, blankets, solar lanterns, buckets, water purification units, medical supplies, and hygiene kits. The relief is directed to over 230,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh fleeing from persecution in Myanmar. They currently live in dire humanitarian conditions in camps and makeshift settlements where they lack the most immediate necessities like food, shelter, water, and clothes. Violence in Myanmar has triggered the exodus of over 520,000 Rohingyas since last August. (KhaleejTimes)
