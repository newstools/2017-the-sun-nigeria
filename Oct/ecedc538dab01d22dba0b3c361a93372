The South-South Reformation Movement (SSRM) has commended the Minister of Sports and Youths Development, Mr Solomon Dalung, over Nigeria’s qualification for Russia 2018 World Cup finals. The group’s Secretary-General, Pastor Magnus Oku, in a statement on Sunday in Abuja, said Dalung had delivered on his vow that Nigeria must be in the Russia 2018 tournament. Nigeria’s Super Eagles on Oct. 7 qualified for 2018 world cup in Russia after beating visitors, Chipolopolo of Zambia 1-0. “Dalung has been following up the World Cup qualifiers series with dexterity; ensuring allowance are paid right on time and that players’ welfare are taken seriously. “He has no doubt proven himself an effective administrator as his efforts have yielded positive results. “Nigeria’s qualification was not without administrative sacrifices as the minister made great sacrifices to minimise  in-house quarreling in the football family that has persisted for years before now,’’ he said. Oku expressed optimism that Nigeria would win its next match against Algeria. (Source: NAN)
