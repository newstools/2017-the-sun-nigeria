From Jeff Amechi Agbodo, Onitsha  The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) under the leadership of Nnamdi Kanu, has commiserated with the management and staff of The Sun Publishing Ltd over the killing of its sales representative in Onitsha, Anambra State, Mr. Fabian Obi, by armed robbers. The group said the untimely death of Obi came as a shock to all, as such heinous crime rarely occurred in the past, stressing that it was a sure sign, if any is needed, that life under the current socio-economic and political climate in Anambra State was no longer safe. A statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, said, “it is quite unfortunate that this type of unfortunate incident could happen in Anambra State governed by Chief Willie Obiano, who has often boasted about his crime fighting credentials. It appears that Governor Obiano’s allegedly use of armed services like the Hausa- Fulani army and police is usually reserved for the unarmed law abiding citizens exercising their right to freedom of assembly and association and not against violent criminals. “We wonder what the governor and his South East counterparts are doing with the security votes meant for securing lives and property in their respective states. We pray to God Almighty to grant the family members of the deceased, the management and staff of The Sun Newspapers Limited, the fortitude to bear the loss.”
