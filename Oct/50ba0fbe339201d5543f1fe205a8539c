Get Good Earplugs This just might be the simple solution to help you deal with living in a noisy area. Earplugs will help cancel some of the noise and make it possible for you to have a semblance of quiet, especially at night when you need to relax and sleep. They are comfortable enough to fall asleep in and help to keep out almost any noise. Talk To The Administrator About It Whether you’re staying in a hotel or in an apartment, if the activities of your neighbour(s) are the cause of the noise, you can first try talking to them about it. If things don’t change, then you can go the administrator and make a complaint about it. The administrator might be able to offer a solution to address the problem and be more successful at getting your neighbour(s) to comply.
