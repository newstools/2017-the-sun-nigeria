From David Onwuchekwa, Nnewi  The chances of the incumbent governor of Anambra State, Chief Willie Obiano, winning the November 18 governorship election has received a boost in Umunankwo, Ogbaru Council Area, as the people of the community have endorsed the governor as their choice and vowed to work for his second tenure. The Umunankwo community, led by its traditional ruler, Igwe Emeka Gilbert Ononuju, took the stand when the Senior Special Assistant to the governor on Political Matters, Mr. Arinzechukwu Awogu, visited the community as part of the ongoing grassroots mobilisation for his reelection. The community thanked Obiano for remembering them and said that erosion was almost cutting off the community from the rest of Ogbaru area when the governor rescued them through the N20 million choose-your-project initiative. They also said that never in the history of the community has any government remembered them for appointment, but that Obiano appointed their son, Mr. Walter Okechukwu Udeze, as Senior Special Assistant on Political Matters, even as they learnt that another appointment was on the way. Igwe Ononuju appealed to the governor to look into the communityâ€™s town union matter with a view to recognising the choice of the majority of the community. He also reminded the state government that the second project that the community is bidding for is a skill acquisition centre, where their teeming youths could learn skills to better their lives, maintaining that any person or persons approaching government with any other project other than a skill acquisition centre did not have the mandate of the community and should be ignored as such will be vehemently resisted by the Umunankwo community.
