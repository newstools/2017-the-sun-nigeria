A member of the House Committee on sports, Hon Danburam Abubakar Nuhu has appealed to Nigerian soccer fans coming to the Nest of Champions to cheer Super Eagles in the all-important World Cup qualifier against Zambia to display act of patriotism by being in our national colors. Nuhu who spoke exclusively to Daily Sunsports in Abuja said it is important for the fans to paint the arena green and white as that would fire up the Eagles to go for the kill. He noted that Nigerians must show their love for the country by wearing our national colors since the match is coming up at a time Nigeria is celebrating her 57th anniversary. “We as Nigerians must emulate what Americans, Ghanaians and citizens of other countries do. If you go to Ghana, you see the average Ghanaian flying the Ghanaian flag in his car. Americans do the same thing…this is the practice world over where people love their country. This is lacking in Nigeria and all that need to change. We need to put Nigeria first in whatever we do if we must move forward as a nation. This is why I m appealing to the fans to come to the Uyo Stadium on October 7 wearing our national colors. When we played the first leg in Zambia, the Zambians did the same. We must motivate our players by painting the stadium with green and white.” The lawmaker who is representing Kano Municipal stressed that the nation’s league organizers LMC and the the Nigeria Football Federation ( NFF) should also use football to preach patriotism since the game is one which every Nigerian love. “I want both the LMC and NFF to use football to drive this message of patriotism. Football is something that unites the country and we can use it to promote our national unity.”
