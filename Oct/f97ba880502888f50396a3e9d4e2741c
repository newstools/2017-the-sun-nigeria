The Lagos State Government has created a short service code to enable residents of the state to report incidents of domestic violence. The short code is code ‘6820’. With your mobile phone, send a message about domestic violence and the location to that number. Officials in the specialized unit will do the needful. Please share; you don’t know who may need it! ► Campaign Against Domestic Violence wrote from Ijegun, Lagos.
