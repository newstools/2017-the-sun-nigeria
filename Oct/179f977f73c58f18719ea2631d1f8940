A Minna Magistratesâ€™ Court on Thursday remanded two men, Sani Audu and Ado Abdullahi, over alleged culpable homicide. The two are standing trial on a two-count charge of criminal conspiracy and culpable homicide, contrary to section 97 and 221 of the penal code law. The police prosecutor, Insp. Ahmed Saidu, had told the court that one Fati Aliyu of Rafi Local Government Area of the state, reported the matter to the police on September 25. Saidu alleged that the accused persons conspired with eight others, now at large, and killed her father, Aliyu Mohammed. When the charges were read to them, the accused persons pleaded guilty and begged the court for leniency, saying they killed Mohammed in retaliation after he killed their own brother over a dispute. The magistrate, Mohammed Gabi, however, declined to take their plea as his court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Gabi directed the Police to forward the case file to the State Director of Public Prosecution for legal advice. He, thereafter, adjourned the matter to November 14, for further mention.
