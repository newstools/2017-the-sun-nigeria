Back then I was doing the DJ thing for fun, whenever we had a house party. But when people began to take me seriously I was invited to London for a gig. I was in Conventry and I had to go all the way to London, somewhere in Swiss Cottage.  I did the show there. It was a normal house party, we had a number of young people there trying to have fun. Then, police came to shut the party down. First day as professional DJ Professionally, it was when I got  back from London in 2010. I came back on holiday and there was a show at Oniru beach. There were like 1,500 people there on the beach. That was my first professional outing as a DJ, it was crazy. It was crazy, the energy of the young people was crazy. First big gig Playing at the Centenary Awards ceremony where 26 heads of state were present. First GSM phone It was a Motorola Talkabout Your first salary as a DJ? If I tell you that one, eeeh, its unbelievable because I got N1.2 million.  But after that one, it started going down. People will offer you 100k, 200k 300k, but because I did so well and I did overtime. I was supposed to be there for four hours, I ended up spending 8hrs from 7a.m. I ended up leaving there by 4a.m the next day. First car It was KIA Capital. That was in 2000. It seems I gave the car to my mechanic. First trip abroad? I was a teenager then. I was very young. I had always been to London with my parents.
