In a bizarre incident, a 12-year-old boy jumped 30 feet off from an overpass above Interstate 66 in northern Virginia and fell onto a car, killing the driver, while the boy extraordinarily survived. The Daily Mail quoted the police saying that the boy landed on a Ford Escape and the impact incapacitated the vehicle’s driver, Marisa Harris, 22, who died on the spot. However, the front-seat passenger survived the accident without any injuries and was able to stop the car after steering it off the interstate. The crash occurred at 4.18pm near Exit 62 in Fairfax County as Harris was driving Eastbound, according to local authorities. According to reports in the Daily Mail, police are not clear yet as to what compelled the boy to jump. The boy, whose identity was not revealed, is being treated for life-threatening injuries.
