At a time many of her contemporaries are gearing up for 2019, Senator Daisy Ehanire Danjuma is thinking of quitting the game. If reports coming from her camp are anything to go by, she has indeed thrown in the towel and bade farewell to the trade that conferred on her the title of ‘Distinguished Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria’.
It was gathered that her decision to quit politics was predicated on her resolve to address the demands of her businesses. The over 60-year-old Benin chief is the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of South Atlantic Petroleum (SAPETRO).
A Law graduate of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, she joined politics in 2003 when she resigned her chairmanship of SAPETRO to contest and later won the Edo South Senatorial District seat. She lost her reelection bid in 2007 but made another attempt in 2011 in either Edo her state of origin or Taraba, the home state of her husband, Gen. T.Y. Danjuma, but also failed to secure the ticket. She has since gone into private business.
Daisy Danjuma began her career as a state counsel in the Department of Public Prosecutions, Lagos State Ministry of Justice and was a pioneer legal counsel at the Legal Aid Council of Nigeria before working for Nigerian Acceptances Ltd. (NAL). She spent the next decade as Company Secretary/Legal Adviser to the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) before she moved into private practice.
