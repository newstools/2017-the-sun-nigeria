The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) on Wednesday donated sanitation equipment to the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Damaturu, Yobe, to enhance their living condition. Mr Gabriel Idoko, the Head, UNHCR in Yobe, presented the materials to the displaced persons at Kukareta IDP Camp in the state in commemoration of the World Refugees Day. According to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, World Refugee Day is observed every June 20 to raise awareness of the situation of refugees throughout the world. “On Dec. 4, 2000, the United Nations General Assembly in Resolution 55/76 decided that, from June 20, 2001, would be celebrated as World Refugee Day. “In this resolution, the General Assembly noted that 2001 marked the 50th anniversary of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. “African Refugees Day had been formally celebrated in several countries prior to 2000. “The UN said that the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) had agreed to have International Refugee Day coincide with Africa Refugee Day on June 20.’’ Idoko said: “We all have a responsibility to build a safe and healthy environment for the displaced persons to live a normal life. “The children also have a right to continue their education under safe living condition,” the UNHCR official said. Idoko said that the society has a responsibility to provide the IDPs with opportunity to be reintegrated, rebuild their lives and recover their economic loss. He urged the officials in charge of the IDPs to maintain clean environment to ensure healthy living. “The UNHCR is partnering with the state’s Ministry of Environment to improve the sanitary condition in the IDP camps. “We have also planted commemoration trees as contribution to improve the environment,” Idoko said.
