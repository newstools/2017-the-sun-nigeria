A Kano Magistrates’ Court, on Thursday, sentenced one Abubakar Auwal, 34, to 20 months imprisonment for alleged cheating. The Chief Magistrate, Ibrahim Khaleel, however gave the convict an option of N35,000 fine. Khaleel ordered the convict to pay the sum of N250,000 as compensation to the nominal complainant. Auwal who resides at Hotoro Quarters Kano, was convicted on a three-count  charge of criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust and cheating. He pleaded guilty to the charges levelled against him. Earlier, the prosecutor, ASP. Anthony Edward, told the court that Auwal and one Kasim Salisu, now at large, committed the offence on May 27 at about 3.30 pm in Sabon Gari, Kano. Edward said that the duo criminally conspired and approached one Abubakar Rabiu of Niger Road, Sabon Gari, with the pretence to buy his Lifan unregistered motorcycle valued at N150,000. “The duo convinced Rabiu to hand over the motorcycle to them for testing,” he said.

The prosecutor said that Auwal used the same motorcycle as a collateral and collected the sum of N100,000 cash from one Musa Muhammad of Yankaba Quarters, Kano. According to the prosecutor, the offence contravened sections 97, 312 and 322 of the penal code. (NAN)
