Three-times champion, Novak Djokovic has been bumped up to second seed for next week’s Wimbledon championship despite slipping to fourth in the ATP world rankings while seven-times champion, Roger Federer has also benefited.
The seedings, released by the All England Club on Wednesday, had defending champion Andy Murray number one in the men’s singles, with Germany’s Angelique Kerber the women’s top seed.
Wimbledon differs from the other grand slams, in the men’s singles at least, with previous form on grass in the previous two years coming into play to re-order the top 32 in the world rankings — a system agreed by the ATP.
Spaniard Rafa Nadal, who won a 10th French Open last month, is second in the ATP rankings but would be seeded fourth at Wimbledon after a mediocre record there in recent years.
Despite winning the title twice, the 31-year-old had not been past the fourth round since 2011.
