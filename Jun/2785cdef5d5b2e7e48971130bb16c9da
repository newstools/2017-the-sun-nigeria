From Laide Raheem, Abeokuta A 20-year-old man, Nurudeen Akintoye, has been arrested in Ogun State for allegedly having unlawful sexual intercourse with an 18-year-old deaf and dumb girl (name withheld).
According the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, the incident occurred on June 7, 2017 at about 9.45p.m when the suspect who resided in Ajura town community in Obafemi Owode Local Government Area lured the victim into a bush and forcefully had sexual intercourse with her.
The victim, who the parents claimed was a virgin before the incident, was bleeding profusely from her private part, the sight which infuriated the people of the area who wanted to lynch the suspect, but for the timely intervention of the DPO of Owode Egba division, CSP Sheu Alao, who led his men to the scene and rescued the suspect from the mob. He was later whisked to the station.
The victim was taken to General Hospital in Owode Egba for immediate medical attention.
Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Iliyasu, has directed that the suspect be transferred to anti human trafficking and child labour unit of the state investigation and intelligence department for further investigation and possible prosecution.
The CP, therefore, warned members of the public to desist from applying jungle justice on anybody suspected of committing any crime emphasising “all suspects are presumed to be innocent until a court of competent jurisdiction states otherwise.” google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3470379246590210";
