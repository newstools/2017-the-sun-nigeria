Respected businessman and  brain behind AES Excellence Club, Dr. Ausbeth Ajagu and his wife, Anuli have been celebrating  and the reason is   their first child and daughter, Vanessa, is now a graduate. The fast blossoming lady who looks so much like her father recently rounded off her studies at Queens University, Kingston, Canada. She bagged a BA in Psychology and any moment from now will be heading to Law school for another degree. By the way, like her cerebral parents, Vanessa graduated with distinction! Our family’s joyful screams were the loudest at the convocation hall. My baby girl, you have done us proud. I pray the Lord strengthens and perfects all that concerns you. To God be the glory, great things He has done!”, her excited mum said of her super achievement.
