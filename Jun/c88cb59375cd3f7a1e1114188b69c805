By Bimbola Oyesola The British producers of electronic appliances and smart gadgets, Binatone, has unveiled a new technological blend of fan incorporated with digital music player.
The speedy and super quiet cooling device discharges a combination of filtered air and quality music blend through its powerfully built speaker.
Binatone Group Chairman, Mr. Partap Lalvani, who spoke at the official launch in Lagos, said the concept was birthed by a suggestion from its Marketing Department to incorporate the two technologies.
He said, “we thought it was impossible but after speaking with a team of Japanese designers and some Chinese companies on producing a compact and quality blue print, the result is the tower fan with digital musical system. The only language the whole world understands is music. Binatone has felt the pulse of the consumer to produce the world’s first music fan.”
He reiterated the firm’s commitment to dominating the sphere of cooling appliances, noting that further efforts would be set in motion to address needs of style and taste with advanced technology.
