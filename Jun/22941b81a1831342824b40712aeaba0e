By Christopher Oji Stakeholders in security yesterday charged Lagosians to know their neighbours if the war against kidnapping, armed robbery, murder and cultism would be won.
The stakeholders, who gave the advice during a town hall meeting with Tradesmen/Artisans Association at Alausa Secretariat, Ikeja, Lagos organised by the Lagos State Security Trust Fund (LSSTF), agreed that crime thrives because “neighbours do not know who live among them.”
Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer, LSSTF, Dr. AbdulRazaq Balogun, during his welcome address, said the tradesmen/artisans were the best people for intelligence gathering, as they operate at the grassroots.
Said he: “They may not know how important they are. They are a very important sector of the economy. They must play critical roles in the support of the war against crime and criminality. They are not only to give information, but should also support the trust fund financially.”
