A member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Caucus, Chief Sam Nkire, has appealed to members who worked for the party at the last election not to defect to new political associations because they were not given political appointments. Nkire said although appointments were part of dividends politicians look forward to after winning an election, what is needed now is hard work and patience, in order to build a strong party that can deliver on promise to the people. Quoting former President Olusegun Obasanjo, he said, “everybody can’t be given political appointment; this is why politicians should have a second address”, adding that “anyone who is not favoured in the first term would be remembered in the second.” He said: “What should be uppermost in our minds as leaders and members of APC is how to finally win the war against insecurity, corruption and economic hardship which the party inherited from the last administration.” Nkire urged party fateful to offer more sacrifice by working harder in order to secure the future of the party and win the general election in 2019, from the ward to local government, state and national levels. He reiterated his call for APC members and Nigerians, in general, to continue to pray for President Muhammadu Buhari to get well soon and come back to fully implement his vision for the country to enable him leave a legacy for the generation unborn. Nkire, who is the leader of the Abia State caucus of APC said despite the fact that APC members in the state were not getting their dues in terms of appointments, the party is growing in leaps and bounds in Abia.
