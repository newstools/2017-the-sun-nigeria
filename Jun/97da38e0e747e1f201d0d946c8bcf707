A second chance is on the way for women who abandoned school to get married, as Federal Government plans to establish special schools for them, Minister of Women Affairs, Aisha Alhassan, has said.
“All women that married at an early age will have the opportunity to continue their education from their husband’s houses.
“The schools will be in two categories so as to avoid problems emanating from the establishment of the schools.”
According to her, the first category would be for those who started their schooling but due to one reason or the other dropped out.
The other category is Adult Literacy classes that would be established in all local governments to assist women to attain certain literacy level.
“In the Adult literacy schools, the women will also be empowered with skills training during their lessons.
“The women will be trained how to make soap, local soft drink, candle, pomade, cake, local hairdressing, tailoring and other small businesses,” the minister told newsmen yesterday in Katsina.
Alhassan appealed to religious and traditional leaders to continue to support ongoing efforts to boost the enrolment of the girl-child into schools nationwide.
The minister who said education of female children was important urged the leaders to encourage parents to send them to school.
