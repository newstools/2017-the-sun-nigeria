Medical workers under the auspices of the Association of Radiographers of Nigeria (ARN) have revolted against the proposed National Council on Radiology and Radiation Medicine Bill.
Addressing journalists at the weekend in Lagos, the president of the association, Elizabeth Balogun, said the bill, which was already in the National Assembly, seeks unhealthy marriage between one regulated profession (radiography) and others.
She said her members were not consulted and had no inputs into the said bill, while
explaining that the bill was vague and fails to lend itself to clear citation, references, understanding, and does not toe the line of international best practices.
The president queried why radiographers, who were already being regulated by Radiographers Registration Board of Nigeria (RRBN) should be subjected to other bodies that don’t have their status of satisfaction and placement.
According to him, “the bill has no respect for the doctrine of double jeopardy as it makes provision for a practitioner to compulsorily register with its council in addition to registration and licensing by the parent board or council. Other duplicities include double disciplinary bodies of coordinate jurisdiction.
“Nigerian radiographers reject the bill and refuse to be associated with it. We are satisfied and stand firmly with RRBN as our regulatory body. We are aware of our legal right to fair hearing and freedom of association.” google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3470379246590210";
