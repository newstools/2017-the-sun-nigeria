By Emma Njoku No fewer than 12,000 patients received free treatments for various ailments during this year’s annual Mbaise USA Incorporated Medical Mission. Leader of the team of medical doctors from the United States, Dr. Vitalis Ojiegbe, who confirmed this, said those treated were the aged and indigent people in various communities in Mbaise. He listed the places where patients were treated to include Ezinihitte, Ekwerazu, Uvuru, Lorji, Ezialakaohu Nguru and St Gregory’s Catholic Church Umuhu. According to him, all referrals for surgery, dental and eye cases were managed at Aboh Mbaise General Hospital. He, however, lamented the poor state of facilities at the hospital and disclosed plans by the Mbaise USA Incorporated Medical Mission to employ and maintain some doctors and nurses at the hospital with a view to alleviating the health problems of Mbaise people. A chat with some of the medical personnel revealed that the most prevalent ailments treated include high blood pressure, diabetics, malaria and eye defects, among others. These were attributed to environmental factors and social habits. Mrs. Immaculata Nkoronye, a Maryland, US based nurse on the mission advised the people to maintain clean environment and healthy eating habit by taking advantage of fresh natural foods in their environments. She also cautioned against abuse of drugs. Dr. Ojiegbe expressed satisfaction at the large turn out of patients, particularly at St. Gregory’s Catholic Church, Umuhu. In a welcome address, Mr. Paul Ikpe, chairman of Umuhu Abroadian council expressed gratitude to Mbaise USA Incorporated Medical Mission for their compassionate gesture towards alleviating the sufferings of Mbaise people. He charged other professionals of Mbaise extraction in diaspora to emulate the laudable example.
