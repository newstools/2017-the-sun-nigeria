As Muslims celebrate Eid-el-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, Enugu State Governor,  Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, has urged them to use the period to offer special prayers for peaceful co-existence , national unity and  the continued progress and sustainability of the dreams of the country’s founding fathers. Ugwuanyi,  who earlier paid a surprise visit to the Muslims at their Central Mosque, on Owerri Road , to felicitate with them, noted that Eid-el-Fitr offers an opportunity for both Muslims and Christians  to continue to live in harmony for the progress of the country. He added that the country’s strength lies in its diversity and ability to overcome challenges despite socio-political differences. Responding, the excited Muslims, through their leader,  Alhaji Yusuf Sambo, (the Sarkin Hausawa)  praised Ugwuanyi for the surprise visit “even when you had earlier sent gift items to us through your Special Adviser on Security Matters, Gen. Fred Eze (retd.)”. Sambo expressed delight at the governor’s visit and uncommon style of leadership, stating that it was a demonstration of his love for every resident of the state irrespective of religion or tribe. He added that Ugwuanyi had paid them similar visit last year and extended gratitude to the people of the state for the harmonious relationship that has been existing between Muslims and Christians. The Muslims promised to ensure that the relationship is sustained for the benefit of the state and the country at large.
