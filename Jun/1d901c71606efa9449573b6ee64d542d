From Emmanuel Uzor, Abakaliki The South East Governorsâ€™ Forum yesterday assured Ndigbo living in all parts of the northern of Nigeria of their safety even as they urged them not to be intimidated by the quit notice issued by the Coalition of Arewa Youths. Chairman of the forum and governor of Ebonyi State, Chief David Umahi while addressing journalists at the Executive Council Chambers, Government House, Abakaliki said the forum after critically appraising the issues rising from the quit notice decided to speak up and to assure their people of safety. He said the governors of the South East received the order on Ndigbo to vacate the northern region by the Coalition of 16 Northern youth as highly provocative statements and called on the Igbo to ignore the call and go about their lawful businesses. He said that the forum has carefully considered the contents of the order a highly provocative statement and had reflected on its implications for Ndigbo specifically and for the status of the federal Republic of Nigeria. Umahi further disclosed that the South East Governorsâ€™ Forum had repeatedly reiterated its commitment to the preference for the existence of a virile, united, prosperous and progressive Nigeria where justice, fairness, equity and respect and equal opportunity to all citizens regardless of ethnicity and gender will reign supreme. â€œThe lives and property of law-abiding citizens of Igbo extraction are as precious as the lives and properties of all Nigerians irrespective of region and these must be guaranteed and defended against all forms of threats, both domestic and external by the security forces of the federal Republic of Nigeria.â€ â€œWe must call on all serious minded patriots, particularly the religious leadership in Northern Nigeria and all other relevant stakeholders to rise with voices of peace and wisdom to counter the mischief and exuberant excesses of the Northern youths.â€ The Governorsâ€™ Forum chairman also denied information earlier in the social media that the governors had met and mobilized for the return of Ndigbo from the north in response to that threat call. Umahi said â€œthe rumours peddled on conventional and social media platforms that the Governorsâ€™ Forum of the South East have met and agreed to mobilize vehicles and cash for the repatriation of Ndigbo in the Northern Nigeria must be disregarded.
