Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, has said the Igbo are being made to ‘suffer forever’ because of the 1967-1970 civil war. According to The Cable, Fayose also said acting President, Yemi Osinbajo, is doing his best to address some challenges in the country but needs to put in more efforts. The governor appealed to the Federal Government to be fair and just to all ethnic groups in the country but opposed the main objective of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), saying secession is not an option. IPOB is in the frontline of the campaign to create an independent state for the Igbo. “The acting president is doing his best but that is not enough. We must remember that those who make positive change impossible make violent change inevitable. “A situation where a section will be suffering forever because of their role in the civil war is not fair. “As much as secession is not an option, the handlers of our democracy must be equitable, fair and just to everyone. “The Igbo have continued to suffer because of the perceived role of the late Ikemba Nnewi, Odumegwu Ojukwu. If we say past administrations did not do well, what has the present administration done differently? “I agree that secession is not desirable but, there must be justice and equity. When people are being killed or vilified, you must expect a reaction. “No region should begin to use power to oppress another. If Nigeria is truly one, it will not get to a stage that one region will openly call on another to leave its land.” The governor said the federal government should dialogue with Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB leader, instead of using force. Fayose accused the Buhari administration of dividing Nigeria more than ever. “It is the legitimate right of the people to agitate if they feel they are wrongly treated.”
