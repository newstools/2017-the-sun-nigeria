by Joe Apu Cameroon coach Hugo Broos has said that he is desperately searching for a ‘deadly’ striker that will facilitate their win against the Super Eagles of Nigeria when both sides meet in August this year for the double header World Cup qualification matches. Broos said this after his team missed several chances to draw 1-1 against Australia at the ongoing FIFA Confederations Cup. After their engagement in the Confederations Cup, Cameroon will take on Nigeria in the World Cup 2018 Qualifiers, where a positive result in the back to back clash will help their bid to overhaul group leaders, N‎igeria. However Broos is of the opinion that a positive result for his team would depend on finding a striker who guarantees goals, as that is what the team lacks at the moment. At the last Africa Cup of Nations which ‎Cameroon won, defender Michael Ngadeu-Ngadjui emerged as top scorer for the team with two goals out of the seven they scored at the Championship which they won in Gabon. ” If you h‎ave one (striker) in mind, please tell me his name and I’ll go straight away and see him,” Broos reportedly said. “We’re searching, we’re searching, we’re searching and we keep on searching but you have to be able to find one. Someone who scores goals. “Yes, it’s very easy to say you haven’t got players who score, but you have to find them. You should know that  Cameroonian football is not as rich (in strikers) at the moment,” he said.
