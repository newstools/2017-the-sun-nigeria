President Vladimir Putin said, on Thursday, that Russia would remove its sanctions on other countries if they removed their sanctions imposed on Moscow. When deciding on extending the sanctions, Russia would consider the attitude of the countries that imposed their sanctions on Moscow, Putin said during his annual question-and-answer session with Russian citizens. He also said that a new round of proposed US sanctions on Russia was evidence of an internal political struggle in the US. The US Senate voted overwhelmingly, on Wednesday, for new sanctions to punish Russia for its alleged meddling in the 2016 US election, and to force President Donald Trump to get Congress’ approval before easing any existing sanctions. Putin said Washington’s policy of imposing sanctions on Moscow on various pretexts had always been to try to contain Russia. (NAN)
