THE Minister of Youth and Sports Barrister Solomon Dalung has appealed to aggrieved contestants of the just concluded National Sports Federations’ Elections to channel their grievances to the Elections Appeals Committee. The Minister who spoke yesterday said it was not unusual to have complaints and grievances coming in the aftermath of every conduct of an electoral process. Barrister Dalung however urged such people to use the provisions made available for protests and complaints emanating from the electoral process. “The beauty of it all is that every credible electoral process has room for ventilation of grievances and in anticipating that we were not going to have a prefect situation, adjudicating bodies were also created to listen to com- plaints arising from these elections. “We should allow the process to terminate and if people don’t get justice they can now say that they were shortchanged or that the process was not transparent and credible, but to point accusing fingers at the Ministry and create imaginary enemies through distasteful statements is unfair.
