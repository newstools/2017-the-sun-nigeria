President Vladimir Putin of Russia has said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) has been constantly looking for an external enemy to justify its existence, the RIA Novosti news agency reported Wednesday. Putin told American director Oliver Stone in an interview that the Eastern Bloc does not exist any more, neither does the Soviet Union, so why NATO is still there. “I have an impression that in order to justify its existence, NATO needs an external enemy. Thus, there is a constant search for an enemy or some provocations,” he said. The Russian president said he has not lost hope for changes in Russian-US relations. Earlier, at the plenary session of the “Business Dialogue between Russia and the US” at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin said Russia is going to continue to engage in dialogue with the new U.S. administration. “Political will and mutual effort are needed for any talks to succeed.” he said.
