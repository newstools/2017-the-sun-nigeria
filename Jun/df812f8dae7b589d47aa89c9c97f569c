The Nigeria Union of Pensioners, on Tuesday urged Federal and state governments to pay pension and workers salaries before the Sallah festival. The union said in statement issued in Abuja by its General Secretary, Mr Actor Zal that the gesture would ease current hardship and allow pensioners and workers celebrate the event without hassle. It particularly noted that most pensioners depend solely on their paltry pensions to meet their financial obligations. The union lauded the Acting President Yemi Oshibajo for the recent release of funds for their payment, and urged for similar release of their pension for June. It stressed that state governments should also make prompt payment of pensions and salaries a priority especially during festivals. The union said that pensioners and workers have spent their little savings observing the Ramadan fast and have little or nothing left to celebrate the Sallah. “We believe that this is a listening government and we are sure the government will accede to our request so that our people can have cause to smile during the celebration,” it added.
