By Paul Erewuba Following news of the ban on the Nigeria Football Supporters Club by the Nigeria Football Federation, NFF, Chairman, board of trustees of the club, Dr. Rafiu Ladipo and national chairman of the club, Rev. Samuel Ikpea have reacted vehemently saying that the football ruling body in Nigeria have no right to do so.
Speaking yesterday in Lagos, the BOT chairman who doubles as President General stated that the supporters club is in no way under the supervision of the NFF and as such had no such powers as to ban them from doing what they know how to do best.
“The NFF cannot stop us from being in Uyo to support the Super Eagles. We will pay our way to Uyo, pay the gate fees to be inside the stadium to cheer the team like we have done over the years.”
A very angry national chairman of the club, Rev. Ikpea on his part noted that it was an unfortunate development for the NFF president, Amaju Pinnick to talk about banning the supporters club.
“The NFF president is not a registered member of the Nigeria Football Supporters Club neither is he a fee paying member. The NSFC is a registered body under the Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC. It is not a body under the NFF but our duty is to provide support for the national teams wherever they are playing.”
We’re saddened that Nigeria has been out of major championships and think that we must do our best to cheer them to victory whenever they are playing.”
On Wednesday, the NFF president was quoted as saying that he would not recognize a factionalised supporters club urging them to dissolve the two executives and conduct new elections.
Pinnick had said, “I have made it clear that the Supporters Club should not come to Uyo for this match on Saturday. I have also told Ladipo to resign and conduct a fresh election. The two warring leaders, Ikpea and Okumagba should also resign because we can’t continue to work with factional leaders.”
