From Tony Osauzo, Benin Operatives of the Edo State Police Command are in search for a lady who allegedly hired assassins to kill her ex-lover, Mr. Okundolor Omoruyi.
Omoruyi, 39, was reportedly killed in May at Utagban Quarters, Egor Local Government Area of Edo State a few weeks after he arrived Nigeria from Italy.
The unidentified lady was said to have plotted the killing of Omoruyi because he jilted her.
Parading two suspects arrested in connection with the killing, the Commissioner of Police, Haliru Gwandu, announced that another 18-year-old girl was killed by the gang for recognising one of them.
He gave assurance that other suspects in the killing would soon be arrested.
One of the suspects, who gave his name as Odion, said the two other fleeing suspects were Power and Moses.
He claimed that Power pulled the trigger that killed Omoruyi, adding that he was only asked to accompany them on the mission.
According to the suspect, the deal to kill Omoruyi was sealed at a bar, but he could not recognise the lady that gave out the job.
He said: “My friend put me into this problem. He said I should follow them somewhere. When we got to a shop, he said I should collect the apron from the seller. I didn’t know how much was in the apron.
“I later saw my friend bring out a gun and kill the girl. They later said we should go to another place, where we killed the man.” google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3470379246590210";
