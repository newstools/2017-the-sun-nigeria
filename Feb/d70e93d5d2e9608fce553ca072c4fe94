A Medview Airline flight from Lagos to Abuja was suspended midair after a fault was observed on the plane. Sources say, a passenger on the flight said passengers suspected the plane, with flight number VL 2102, was faulty before take-off, but they were assured by the pilot and the crew that all was well. The passenger went further to claim that few minutes after take-off, the plane had to return to the Lagos Airport due to the problem. “They want to kill over 100 passengers with their faulty plane,” a passenger, Oladejo Olowu said. Reports have it that the plane was scheduled to get to Abuja before a final journey to Yola, Adamawa State. The Medview incident happened a day after a Boeing 737 aircraft belonging to Air Peace on Monday suffered a burst tyre while preparing for take-off at the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos. The incident occurred at about 11a.m. forcing the pilot to abort the flight.
