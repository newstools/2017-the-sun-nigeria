England captain Wayne Rooney says he is staying at Manchester United, after being linked with a move to China. The 31-year-old striker said he hoped to “play a full part” in the rest of the Premier League club’s season. United boss Jose Mourinho had refused to rule out the prospect of Rooney’s exit this month, although a deal before the Chinese transfer window closes on 28 February was always unlikely. “It’s an exciting time at the club and I want to remain a part,” said Rooney. Rooney’s agent, Paul Stretford, has been in China to see if he could negotiate a deal, although it is not known which clubs he spoke to. However, two of the three clubs who looked the most likely options – Beijing Guoan and Jiangsu Suning – dismissed speculation about a transfer. Rooney’s representatives had already spoken to the third option – Tianjin Quanjian – but their coach, Fabio Cannavaro, said talks did not progress. “Despite the interest which has been shown from other clubs, for which I’m grateful, I want to end recent speculation and say that I am staying at Manchester United. “I hope I will play a full part in helping the team in its fight for success on four fronts. “It’s an exciting time at the club and I want to remain a part of it.” source: bbc.com
