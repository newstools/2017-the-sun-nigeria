by Ayodele Lawal Actress cum TV presenter, Olaide Olaogun, has diversified into fashion business. Olaogun, who started her acting career from Wale Adenuga Productions’ Superstory, recently floated a clothing line for the upwardly mobile women. According to the actress, her clothing line tagged ‘RTWO’ (Ready To Wear Olaide), a combination of local and foreign material, became necessary because of her age long ambition to join the fashion scene. “It is my special gift for Nigerian women and the entire fashion industry,” she said. A graduate of English, Olaogun came into international reckoning when she bagged a multi-million-naira deal as a brand ambassador of Lux beauty soap. She later began a TV show, ‘Soul Sisters’ before going into fashion business.
