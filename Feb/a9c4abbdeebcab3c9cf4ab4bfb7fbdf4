A former national vice chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the South-east zone, Chief Nyerere Anyim, says Nigerians should be grateful to God for giving them President Muhammadu Buhari as leader at this critical time of the nation’s history. He, therefore, absolved President Buhari of any blame currently facing Nigeria. President Buhari has been under criticisms for not tackling Nigeria’s problems head-on. According to Chief Anyim, Nigeria would have been history by now but for God’s intervention with the ingenuity of President Muhammadu Buhari. He added that President Buhari met a government that was rotten and will take time to fix, Daily Trust reports. He also said the fact that the president endured to sustain the country this far was one of his numerous achievements since he took over in 2015. His words: “The fight against corruption is just a segment of the things Buhari is doing. But you know that corruption is a cankerworm that has eaten deep into the main fabrics of our socio-economic life. “It is wrong to have the notion that it is only non-APC members that the corruption searchlight is beaming at. There is a proverb in my place that says ‘the ocean will not allow somebody it did not see his legs get drown in it.’ “Somebody will not eat and another person will just start purging; a good example is the Dasukigate. How many non-PDP members benefitted from that? How will you arrest somebody who was not part of the fraud? That is why it appears as if it is only PDP members that are being prosecuted. “Yes, they are talking but nobody has mentioned anybody apart from their clique that benefited in the booty.”
