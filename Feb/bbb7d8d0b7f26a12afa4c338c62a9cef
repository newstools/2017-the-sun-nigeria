Top acts including Ras Kimono, Okey Bakassi, Solid Star, Gordons, Akpororo and Kennyblaq have been penciled to headline Lafta Card, a live comedy concert, which is being organised by Monkals. Scheduled to hold at Cultural Center Complex, Calabar, Cross River State on March 12, 2017; other showstoppers on the bill are Prof. Aboki, MC Mbakara, HOD, Patrick Shadow, MC George, Dauda, and De Don. According to Mong Kalu aka Monkals, an Airtel ambassador, holding the event at this time is mandatory. Hear him: “We will be holding this show at this time, because despite the economic recession, we need to bolster hope and give inspiration to both the participants and all the citizenry alike. This event is a home-coming of sorts.” Monkals stressed that Calabar fans who have for long been waiting for him to bring his show home will be thrilled to no end. He also noted that the occasion “will serve as a platform to encourage some of the up and coming acts.” The event is packaged by Smile Global Entertainment and powered by PGK with the support of Airtel Nigeria, Air Peace, Hit FM, CRBC, and Eddy Liz and among others.
