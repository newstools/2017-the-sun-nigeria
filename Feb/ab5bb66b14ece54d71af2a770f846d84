 From: Paul Osuyi, Asaba Tragedy, on Wednesday, befell Okwagbe community in Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State when a mother of five, identified as Mrs. Atisin Opviarho, was allegedly beheaded by unknown persons suspected to be ritualists in her farm. The victim popularly referred to as ‘Mama’ by community folks, was said to have gone to the farm with her neighbours on the early hours of the day. But she never returned alive to the warm embrace of her relatives as assailants attacked her and slit her throat, according to a source in the community who further alleged that the intention of the killers was to use her parts for rituals. “They went to the farm this morning as usual. So when they got to their respective farms which share common boundaries, everyone was working in their separate farms until it was time to go home. “They called out to her but there was no response. So they decided to walk into her farm, only to discover, after some meters in, her lifeless body in the pool of blood. Her throat was cut with a knife. “From what was observed from the corpse, the assailants were about removing some vital parts but maybe because others were approaching, they quickly abandoned it and took to their heels. We suspect a case of ritual killing,” the source said. Meanwhile, the corpse of the victim has been deposited at the mortuary of General Hospital, Otu-Jeremi, which is the headquarter of Ughelli South council area. Public Relations Officer of the state police command, DSP Andrew Aniamaka, who confirmed the incident, in Asaba, said detectives were already investigating the murder case, and urged residents in the community to remain calm and avoid taking laws into their hands.
