Antalyaspor forward Samuel Eto’o reflected on an emotional moment after Cameroon won the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon. The Indomitable Lions came from a goal down to silence Egypt for their fifth title at the Stade de l’Amitié on Sunday, which mean they will represent Africa at the 2017 Confederations Cup in Russia. Eto’o via social media paid tribute to Marc-Vivien Foé who collapsed and passed on in the 73rd minute of the Confederations Cup semi-final between Cameroon and Colombia at Lyon’s Stade de Gerland. According to him, Hugo Broos’ men will make the fallen hero proud when the competition begins in Russia in June. ‘’Seeing Cameroun at #ConfedCup reminds me of 2003… We will never forget you, Foé! This team will make you proud, where ever you may be,’’ Eto’o tweeted. The reigning African champions begin their campaign against Copa America kings Chile at the Spartak Stadium, Moscow on June 18. Four days later, they face Australia in St. Petersburg before meeting the Germans in Sochi on June 25, 2017.
