The Chinese government will offer 1 million dollars of emergency humanitarian aid to quake-hit Philippines, an official statement said on Thursday. According to an online Ministry of Commerce statement, China hopes the assistance will help relief work after an earthquake struck a southern Philippines province recently. A magnitude 6.7 earthquake hit Surigao city in the southern Philippines on February 10, killing no fewer than seven and injuring over 100. It said that infrastructure facilities including airport and roads were damaged during the quake. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday that the Red Cross Society of China would offer 50,000 dollars to the Philippines for relief work. Geng added that the Foreign Minister Wang Yi had conveyed sympathy to his counterpart in the Philippines. “China believes that the Philippines will overcome their difficulties and recover from the earthquake at an early date,’’ Geng said.
