The management of the University of Lagos has enforced a dress code for the students of the institution in a bid to check indecent dressing on campus. The school authority says it has observed that some students dress indecently for lectures. The dress code which affects both male and female students of the institution, prohibits the wearing of mini-skirts, spaghetti tops, low waist jeans, tight strapless and revealing clothes among others. The circular enforcing the dress code which was pasted in the school, stated clearly that lecturers and administrators are empowered to correct/exclude students from lectures and official business when they are not properly dressed.
