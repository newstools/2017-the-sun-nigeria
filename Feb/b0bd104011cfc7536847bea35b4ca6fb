Belgium Europa League campaigners Gent have added two Nigerians to their squad ahead of their Europa League knock out tie against Tottenham Hotspur. Super Eagles defender William Troost-Ekong and forward Samuel Kalu have been officially added to their updated Europa League squad submitted to UEFA. Ekong rejoined the team after an 18 months loan spell with Norwegian side FK Haugesund, where he rose to the rank of captain of the team, and also cemented his spot in the Nigeria national team during his time at the club. Since returning to Gent, he has only played in one game, missing the two other games they have played in the year 2017, but the clash against Spurs will hold special significance for the 23 year old. He started his career at Spurs as a youngster alongside the clubâ€™s feared striker Harry Kane, who he could be up against if he gets to play in the tie on the 16th of February. Kalu joined the team during the winter transfer window from Slovakian side AS Trencin, and despite earning high praises for his performances in his first two games he was missing yesterday when they drew 1-1 against Zulte-Waregem.
