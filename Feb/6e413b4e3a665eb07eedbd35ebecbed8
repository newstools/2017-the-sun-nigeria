The acting EFCC boss said another N1.25 billion was recovered from a public servant a fortnight ago. Magu identified “corruption fighting back” as the greatest challenge to his agency.

Giving breakdown of the 2016 appropriated allocation, Magu disclosed that the total approved budget of N18.887 billion only N14.739 billion representing 78.04 percent was fully released. He explained that the sum of N7.621 billion was for personnel cost, overhead was N2.750 billion (N10.402 billion as total recurrent), while capital was N8.485 billion for year 2016 adding that 91.1 percent component of the fund released has so far been implemented.
