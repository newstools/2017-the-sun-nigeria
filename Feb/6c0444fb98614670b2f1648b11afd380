General Manager of Jos Metropolitan Development Board (JMDB), Mr Mathaias Hata, on Wednesday, said the agency had demolished nine illegal structures. Hata said that the demolished structures were built on flood-prone areas under high tension electric poles and on lands proposed for roads. He said the demolished structures had long been marked and their owners notified. The JMDB boss said the agency would start frequent demolition of illegal structures to ensure compliance with the laid down rules and town planning laws. He said officers of the board were still looking for more illegal structures to mark for demolition. “Jos is a beautiful place with many natural endowments and we must work hard not to deface the metropolis,’’ Hata said. He said the board was established to return the beauty of the metropolis and warned that defaulters would be sanctioned. Hata advised residents against building in unplanned areas and follow due process when acquiring landed properties. (NAN)
