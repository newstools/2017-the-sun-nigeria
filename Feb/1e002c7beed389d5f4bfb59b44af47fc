Wife of President Muhammad Buhari, Aisha, yesterday, noted there are lots of lessons to learn from the life of her husband who contested the presidential election four consecutive times before he eventually won on March 28,  2015. The First Lady, who spoke in Abeokuta, Ogun State, during the launch of a book entitled, “Buhari vs Yar’Adua: Facing the future,” written by Special Assistant on Media to Governor Ibikunle Amosun, Mr Opeyemi Soyombo, said: “There are lots of lessons to learn from the life of President Buhari, most especially his doggedness and compassion for the masses. President Buhari contested presidential election four consecutively times before he eventually won in 2015. “His victory has paid off considering his passion to helping the masses and most importantly, the successes recorded in the anti-corruption war of his government. “I commend the efforts of the writer for documenting the presidential election suit between the candidate of the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), General Buhari and the late President Umaru Yar’Adua of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2007.” Mrs. Buhari, who was represented by Ogun State governor’s wife, Olufunso Amosun, lauded the author for documenting the legal struggles of her husband in 2007 and also, enjoined Nigerians to emulate her husband’s doggedness by never giving up on their cherished aspirations. She noted how, after several failed attempts, her husband became the nation’s president, following his persistence and compassion for the masses.
