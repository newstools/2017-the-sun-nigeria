A Federal High Court in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State has reportedly sacked Senator Bassey Akpan who is representing Akwa Ibom North-East Senatorial in the National Assembly. The court delivered its judgement, on Monday, asking Sen. Akpan to vacate the Senate and that Bassey Etim was the authentic Senatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The court insisted that Akpan contested for the PDP governorship ticket in state in 2015 and not for the senatorship and therefore does not deserve to be in the hallowed chamber. In its judgement, the court asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to issue a Certificate of Return to Mr. Etim and also asked the Senate to duly swear him in. The court gave Mr. Akpan who served as commissioner for finance during the administration of Godswill Akpabio 90 days to refund all the money he has received as emoluments so far from the national assembly. Mr. Akpan is the chairman of the Senate committee on gas and is expected to be replaced by Etim who is a former member of the Federal House of Representatives
