The police have prevented the Ahmed Makarfi faction of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from converging on the International Conference Center (ICC) for a meeting. Makarfiâ€™s group chose the venue after the ruling of the appeal court which recognised Ali Modu Sheriff as the legitimate chairman of the PDP. On Friday, an appeal court sitting in Port Harcourt ruled in favour of Sheriff and also declared the convention which produced the caretaker committee led by Makarfi as illegal.
