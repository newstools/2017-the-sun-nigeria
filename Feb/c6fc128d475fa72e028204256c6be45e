Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State has dismissed insinuations that he is one of the power brokers in the Muhammadu Buhari administration. The governor made the clarification while speaking to select journalists, in Lagos, recently. Various media reports have described the diminutive governor as one of the most influential individuals in the scheme of things in As Rock. But the governor dismissed the reports, saying he  is not one of those influencing things at the Presidential Villa. He, however, said he is close to President Buhari due to their working relationship when they were both members of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC). His words: ‘’I worked very closely with him in the CPC when everyone had given up on him. I know him, I know how he thinks and he trusts me. He knows that I am driven by public interest. Do I participate in federal decision making? I don’t. ‘’I am too busy addressing Kaduna problems to be part of it. When I am called for an opinion or when I happen to be around, and I have an input or if I see something going seriously wrong; I drive and go and see Mr. President I have heard A, B, C, D. I don’t think it is not right, you should consider doing C, D, E. I do that and I drive back to Kaduna. ‘’My primary assignment is Kaduna. I am not involved in the federal government. People like to say and attribute so much to me, and sometimes it is good for me, it gives me a larger than life image.” The governor confirmed that there is a cabal in Aso Rock, but made reference to the fact that there is a cabal in every organisation. ‘’Even in your own newspaper houses, there is a cabal. Nobody can run an institution without a coterie of two, three, four trusted people. ‘’There is always a cabal; the issue is whether it is a positive or a disruptive cabal. Am I a member of the cabal? No, I am governor of Kaduna state; I work for Kaduna state 24/7,’’ he added.
