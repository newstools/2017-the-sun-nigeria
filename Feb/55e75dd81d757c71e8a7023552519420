A Second Republic lawmaker Junaid Mohammed had raised the alarm over a cabal allegedly surrounding President Muhammadu Buhari. Mohammed said the cabal around the president was intent on destroying Nigeria as a country. He said if Nigerians were not careful, the incident would continue until the country collapsed. The former lawmaker also condemned the manner at which the presidency was handling issues of President Buhari’s health. According to him, “What is happening right now is very unfortunate because evidence has since shown that the President’s handlers are not telling us the truth.” “They are playing on the intelligence of the masses, who took time to register, vote and some even died while voting. I feel Nigerians deserve better than what we are getting right now,” Mohammed said. He also said the 1999 Constitution (as amended) is clear on the inability of the president to perform his duty. He urged President Buhari to resign rather than hold onto power. “If the National Assembly does not move to impeach the President, corruption will continue in this government. The plan by the cabal around Buhari is to bundle him into the country and make it look as if he is ruling when he is not actually in charge. “The cabal does not mean well for this country and if we are not careful, they will ruin this country,” he said.
