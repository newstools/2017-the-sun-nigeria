Star of Oyoyo Prophets, Abigail Nebechi, has opened up on sexual harassment in a chat with Daily Sun. “Before I got my first movie role it was rough. Wherever I went people wanted to take me to bed for roles. They were so blinded they couldn’t see my talent shining through. It was a case of ‘you either do it my way you hit the highway’ and I lost a good number of roles. I was like ‘how many people am I going to sleep with before I get known.’ So I took a walk believing that someday, God will bring somebody my way that will recognize my talents and transform my career.” And that change finally happened when she hooked up with Chibuzor Emereoun, the boss of Pressing Forward Productions and Mrs. Vera Kalu who gave her her first role which eventually culminated in her first lead role in Oyoyo Prophets. To date, Abigail has starred in over 40 movies and still counting.
