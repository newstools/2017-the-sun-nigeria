From Paul Osuyi, Asaba SOME youths suspected to be thugs yesterday disrupted a town hall meeting of South-South delegates of the faction of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), loyal to the Senator Ali Modu Sheriff in Asaba, capital of Delta State. Daily Sun gathered that the venue of the meeting, a popular hotel in the state capital was said to have been booked by a youth group with the time of both meetings clashing. It was learnt that the management of the hotel had to put off the factional PDP’s meeting in preference for the youth gathering when the atmosphere became charged. This was even as security operatives moved-in to save the situation by sealing-off the venue of the meetiång. The PDP factional meeting later moved to Agbor, about 70 kilometres  from the state capital where Senator Sheriff addressed  teeming supporters and party loyalists. In attendance were the Deputy Chairman, Cairo Ojougboh, member of the Board of Trustees, Mrs. Mariam Ali, member of the House of Representatives, Mr. E .J. Agbonyima from Edo State, the gubernatorial candidate of the party in Edo State, Matthew Iduoriyekemwen, among others. Sheriff said as a law-abiding political party, PDP members will abide by any decision of the Appeal Court on the lingering leadership crisis. He said they will wait for the courts to decide who is right or wrong between his faction and the other faction, led by Senator Ahmed Markafi caretaker committee. Sheriff recalled how leaders of the party approached him to become the national chairman of the PDP after the resignation of Alhaji Adamu Muazu. “Let me put the record straight, I never bargained to be national chairman of the PDP. I was sitting in the comfort of my house when leaders of the party across the country came and appealed to me to come and revamp the party,” he said.
