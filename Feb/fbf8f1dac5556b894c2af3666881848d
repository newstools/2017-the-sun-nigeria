You are shocked at the headline right? Well, I have no apologies for that really but before you crucify me, read through. Ayoola got married to Kelvin when she was in her mid twenties. Before she got married, she had a thriving business while her husband worked as a civil servant. By the time she was in her 30s, she had built her first house in her husband’s name, because it didn’t seem right for a woman to own a house. Some years into their marriage, Kelvin suggested to Ayoola that they should both pool their funds together and as a virtuous wife she agreed. Ayoola contributed about 80% of the money while her husband contributed 20% and Kelvin dictated how the money was spent. After Ayoola had her third daughter, she noticed some changes in their marriage as Kelvin started spending lavishly on women and eventually he pushed his wife out because he wanted a son. Ayoola was sent out of the house she built with her hard earned money, but she had no claims to it, because she built the house in her husband’s name. She was heartbroken and had to start afresh again. Tell me, if you had a sister in your family, would like her to end up like Ayoola? I’m sure you have heard so many stories like this and you have heard about how women suffered, because they gave all to a man they loved. Even if it’s all rainbows and unicorns at the beginning of any relationship, it can still get sour after a while. Did I hear you say, “God forbid?” Well, I will also help you say a resounding “amen!” Hello women, remember that many women in failed marriages also had a beautiful love story before things fell apart. They didn’t envisage that beautiful love story would turn sour. It’s only wise for you as mother and wife to secure your future and that of your children in a failed marriage. You should know times are changing and things are very different now. The heart of men is desperately wicked and if you don’t want to be left stranded when your man leaves you, then buy as much as you can in your name. If you don’t want to be left homeless when he runs off with the other woman, you should be prepared! Are you in an abusive relationship? Is your husband domineering? If yes, then listen attentively to me. Many abusers know that having economic control over their spouses will prevent them from leaving.  That is why they keep restricting their access to money.  Financial decency is enough reason why many women in abusive relationship will still stay put in their misery. Even when they leave their abuser, financial insecurity still leads them right back into the arms of the bully. So, if you are one of these women or you know someone who is, then financial planning should be your number one exit strategy. I know you have been praying and fasting. I won’t ask you to stop but while you are doing all these spiritual gymnastics, you should also be wise too, because when you have had enough of his bullshit and want to move on you won’t be leaving penniless and in poverty for the rest of your life. Act now! Start setting aside off money. When you need to buy things for the children inflate the budget and save the rest. By doing this, when he is threatening you with divorce you won’t feel as if your world has crashed, you will tell him to go to hell. Are you one of those wives living in an artificial bubble? Your husband makes so much money; you live in a mansion in a highbrow area with different exotic cars. He buys you expensive gifts and sends you on expensive vacations every year with the kids.  Your hairdo is worth a plot of land in Alagbado area. Your designer shoes and bags cost as much as some children’s school fees. The truth about this is that your husband spoils you but he doesn’t respect you. He is a renowned award winning community penis. You have sacked all your female helps and employed male help because of his randy nature. Lately, you have warned all your nieces and cousins not to visit you when he is around and you’ve lost count of the STDs he has infected you with. Big sis, you need to put on your thinking cap, it’s possible that he might decide you are no longer enough for him and that he wants to legalize his adultery. So, if you are a housewife, go get something doing, even if it is a small business. Start investing more on something more lucrative instead of indulging in your beauty rituals. Another category of women is housewives with not-so- rich husbands. After they had their first child; their husbands succeeded in convincing them to throw out their dreams. They have buried their careers because of their children.  These men have promised their wives they will pay them salaries but these salaries have never been paid. These husbands are just hustlers working in paid employments. I’m not saying taking care of your children is not a good thing and I know this has worked for some people too. Moreover, I know you love to be a career woman and you have tried all you can to convince him, but you still have to work harder at it. It is enough that you have to wait for him to come home before you buy matches. I know how hard it is for you to walk up to him at end of every cycle for sanitary towels. But, there are deeper questions, you need to start asking. What if he loses his job tomorrow? What happens to your children?  How do you pay their school fees? How do you pay the rent? Will you start running from one relation to the other? Madam, dust your CV and get it updated. Excuse me virtuous woman, is your money held in a joint account and you know that marriage is only a farce? You know you guys no longer have common interest and you are only roommates.  The truth is, one day, your husband can strip you bare of your money without your knowledge or permission. This is what you can do; every time you withdraw money from the ATM, pull out extra and add it to your stash.  If you are lucky he gives you money for Christmas or birthdays for the children, save half of it and don’t tell anyone about it. In addition to this, go and open a new account, the one that will be different from the one he knows about. Stash the money there and make sure all the documents are not in the house. If you are working and making money, all properties you are buying should be documented in your name or your children’s names. However, if he insists on putting his name and you are still so much in love with him, let it be in both your names and never in his name alone. Never ever sign any papers you are not sure about; always make sure you flip through thoroughly and when you are not sure about some things, sneak it to a professional before you sign. Interestingly, when it comes to managing finances, many women let their husband take total control. If you know the future of your marriage is uncertain, make him go through your finance with you. You have a right to know every detail.  If he doesn’t agree, start pulling out something tangible to save for the future. All of these sound reactionary and distrustful right? Dear women, you all need to be on your guard, you can’t simply assume your husband will always want to remain married or if you choose to divorce him, he will look out for your own best interest. However, if you are 100% certain that you are in a happy marriage, just flip through this and be entertained. But if not, you are the only who knows where your shoe pinches most so, study this. It is not my fault I am teaching your wives “bad bad” things today! I only love my women and want them to be financially independent after the heartbreak. Women are usually the worst hit after a divorce or separation.
