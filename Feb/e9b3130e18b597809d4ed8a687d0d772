Indeed it was a cliffhanger. Nigerians had looked forward to Monday, February 6, when Tuface would lead a national protest. However, at the very last minute, the Afro pop singer had canceled the demonstrations. However, all is not lost. The act still has what it takes to bring about that change he desires and he does not necessarily need to go on the streets and lead demonstrations that could be hijacked by hoodlums. According to an industry watcher, the way forward is for Tuface to dedicate his music towards activism: “Look at Fela’s Suffering and Smiling or Victor Olaiya’s classic, Ola Ilu le Koso ow lo de. “These songs captured the mood of the nation. Is suffering and smiling not what we are doing now? He should not underrate the power of his music but use it as a tool just like Bob Marley and so many great song writers did once upon a time.”
