 From: David Onwuchekwa, Nnewi More than 2,000 supporters of Governor Willie Obiano for second tenure, on Tuesday, rallied at Tim Okpala Memorial Town Hall, Adazi-Enu in Anocha Local Government Area of Anambra State uring the governor to give a shot at the seat the second time. The governorship election in the state is scheduled for November 2017. The event, which was organised by stakeholders for Governor Obiano 2nd Tenure with Chief Ekene Enefe as National Coordinator, attracted heavy attendance. The people are currently visiting major communities in the three senatorial zones in Anambra to drum support for the governor’s second term bid. Those behind the move are said to include traditional rulers, government officials, artisans, farmers and businessmen like Mr. Emeka Okafor, a honey bee farmer, Ichie  Okwuchukwu Oduagu, Benson Ezeike and people from all works of life. Addressing the supporters, Chief Enefe advised them to translate their support for Governor Obiano to voting proper when the election comes up. He assured them that everything would be put in place to protect their votes, adding that the Anambra people were politically conscious and would not be deceived by ‘enemies of the state’.
