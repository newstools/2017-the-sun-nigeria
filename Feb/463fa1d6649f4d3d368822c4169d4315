From Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa Workers of Bayelsa State Broadcasting Corporation (Glory FM) have downed tools and shut down the station over an industrial dispute with its management. The management has, however, vowed not to allow the workers sabotage efforts of Governor Henry Seriake Dickson’s administration. The workers, under the aegis of Radio Bayelsa chapel of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) and Radio Television and Theatre Arts Workers Unions (RATTAWU), yesterday, ensured the station went off air. The management, in its efforts to downplay the industrial dispute in the station, mobilised few employees who rebuffed the strike, reopened the station but could not broadcast to listeners. Daily Sun gathered that workers have been having a running battle with the recently appointed General Manager, Dr John Idumange, over his management style.However, matters got to a head after the reported arrest of the station’s accountant and alleged whipping of staff, including union officials, by youths. The workers, in a statement signed by Tonye Yemoleigha and Pius Otiti, Chairmen of NUJ and RATTAWU, respectively, said they wanted Idumange to immediately withdraw employment letters recently issued to some persons in the station. They said there was no justification for employment when the General Manager, who was appointed on December 6, 2016, had lamented that the station was over staffed and, subsequently, redeployed competent workers from the FM station. The workers expressed frustration that despite the availability of funds, the 350KVA generator acquired for smooth operations has remained unserviceable since December 2016. Reacting to the development, Idumange dismissed the allegations levelled against him, noting that the unions were being used to sabotage his efforts at repositioning the station which was in a deplorable state before his appointment.
