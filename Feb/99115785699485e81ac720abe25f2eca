From Clement Adeyi, Osogbo The management of Adeleke University, Osogbo, Osun State, has introduced a work-study programme for its students as a part of proactive measures to survive the current recession in the country. The Vice Chancellor of the university, Prof. Ekundayo Alao, who disclosed this to newsmen during its 6th matriculation, in which 840 new students admitted for its 2016/2017 academic session, took part, stressed that the work-study programme became imperative to assist the students in eking out a living while in school. He noted that with the initiative and the little measure of financial freedom that comes with it, many of the students who he said would no longer depend solely on their parents for the supply of their basic needs, would be able to concentrate on their studies “since they won’t be lacking anything while in school.” According to him, there is a timetable that determines academic works and job schedules, adding that the job period did not clash with their study timetable, nor will it have any adverse effect on their studies. Prof. Alao who noted that that the work-study programme was a part of industrialization, entrepreneurship and dignity of labour initiatives for job creation, disclosed that the university had introduced a series of skill acquisition and entrepreneurial programmes where students are given basic trainings to assist them in creating jobs for themselves after graduation. While addressing the matriculating students, he charged them to show total commitment to their studies in order to come out in flying colours and be useful to themselves, their families and society. He told them that the future of the country depended on the youth who can assert themselves in basic skills, relevant knowledge, technology and information.
