House Leader, Sokoto State House of Assembly, Alhaji Garba Bello, says he has disbursed N 1.49 million as interest-free loan to 120 in his constituency, in Yabo. Bello disclosed this, in Gusau, on Wednesday, on the sideline of a three-day workshop organised by a USAID-assisted Leadership, Empowerment, Advocacy and Development (LEAD), Project being implemented in Sokoto and Bauchi states. The workshop has the theme:”2016 Sokoto State Budget Performance Review and Public Hearing on 2017 Budget Workshop.” The legislator said that each of the women was given N10, 000, repayable in 10 months. Bello said: ”In addition to the money, I spent N 2,000 to open bank account for each of the women, as well as the procurement of cheque books and ATM cards. ”They have a grace of two months after which they will commence the repayment of N 1,000 monthly. “This is to ensure that more women benefit from the gesture and become more self reliant as well as contribute their quota to economic growth of the state”.
