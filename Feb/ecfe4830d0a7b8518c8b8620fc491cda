Acting president Yemi Osinbajo and former president, Olusegun Obasanjo were among dignitaries at this year’s Murtala Muhhammed Foundation Lecture series, in Abuja, on Monday. The Murtala Muhammed Foundation is an organisation founded on the ideals of late General Murtala Muhammed and committed to improving the lives of Nigerians and Africans and has led efforts to develop innovative approaches to dealing with the challenges facing the country. Murtala who was Nigeria’s 3rd military head of state was assassinated on his way to work in Lagos state during an abortive coup led by Lt-Colonel B.S. Dimka on February 13, 1976. In the short time of his reign Muhammed’s policies won him broad popular support, and his decisiveness elevated him to the status of a folk hero.
