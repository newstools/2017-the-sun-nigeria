From: Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure Barely three days to the end of his administration, the organised labour in Ondo State has raised the alarm that Governor Olusegun Mimiko is massively looting the state’s treasury. Mimiko, whose tenure ends, on Friday, was alleged to have connived with the state’s Accountant General, Mr. Laolu Akindolire, to loot the state’s treasury. To this end, the state chapters of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Trade Union Congress (TUC) and Joint Negotiation Council (JNC) have warned the Accountant General not to release fund to Mimiko again. It was alleged that the Accountant-General has, however, vacated his office and residence and attempts to see him by the labour leaders have been futile. It was gathered that all the calls made to the Accountant-General were neither answered nor returned. In a letter jointly signed by the JNC chairman, Mr. Sunday Adeleye, Mrs. Bosede Daramola of NLC and Soladoye Ekundayo of the TUC, the organised labour warned the Accountant-General against acts that could tarnish his image. The labour leaders noted that they were aware of a ground plot to mop up all funds in the state government’s accounts to finance frivolous projects by the outgoing administration. Already, Mimiko’s administration is owing workers in the state seven months’ salary arrears. The labour leaders also alleged that the state government has concluded plans to renege on the agreement reached with the organised labour with respect to the Paris club fund.
