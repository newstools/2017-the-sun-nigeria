Unknown gunmen today, shot three Bakassi (Vigilante) boys in broad daylight along Aba Owerri road, Aba.  The incident which took place before MCC Junction, opposite Seven Day Adventist Church (Sabbath) by Toonak claimed the life of three vigilante men. According to reports, the vigilante group disrupted the gunmen operation when they attempted to kidnapp a wealthy businessman by Tonimas, opposite Bicoz Filling Station, along Enugu/Port Hacourt express way. Irked by the action of the Vigilante group, the hoodlums went on a rampage by tracing the Hilux of the vigilante men, double-crossed their vehicle and taking the vigilante men unawares, killing three on the spot. We gathered that two of the vigilante officers who fled the scene survived, but are currently receiving treatment at the Teaching Hospital in Aba.
