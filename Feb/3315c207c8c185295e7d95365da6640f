The Assistant Controller General, Nigeria Prisons Service, Zone D, Mr Mayala  Musa, on Thursday, February 2, urged wealthy Nigerians to support the service in the training of inmates to make them better citizens. Musa, who made the appealed in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Minna, said it was important to offer skills training to the inmates to turn them away from crime. He said that the prisons was supposed to serve as a reformatory through which the inmates would be imbued with new thinking and orientation, to be self reliant and responsible citizens after serving their jail terms. The controller, therefore, said that such intervention by wealthy Nigerians and corporate bodies would encourage prison authorities to carry out their statutory roles more effectively. “Wealthy individuals should promote internal security by creating job opportunities for inmates through the setting up and equipping of skill acquisition centres with basic learning facilities” Musa added.
