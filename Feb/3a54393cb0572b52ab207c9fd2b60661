From: Desmond Mgboh, Kano Emir of Kano, Muhammed Sanusi II, has counseled Local Government chairmen in the state to desist from actions that were likely to encourage disputes between herders and farmers. Emir Sanusi, who gave the advice at a two- day workshop organised by the Kano State Ministry of Local Government, stressed that many Local Government Chairmen in the state were in the habit of selling grazing reserve areas to individuals. Speaking at the workshop with the theme, “Managing Security at Local Government Level”,  the Emir urged the state government to be proactive in addressing the situation so to prevent the looming crisis in the affected Councils.
