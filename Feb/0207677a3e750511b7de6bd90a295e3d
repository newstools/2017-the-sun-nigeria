From: Ali Abare, Gombe The Gombe State Police Command says it would deploy seven thousand policemen to provide security during the scheduled Saturday, February 25 local government election. State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Austin Iwar, disclosed this when he received a protest letter presented to him by the Coalition of Progressives Political Parties (CPPP) in the state that visited him at the Command headquarters. The Police Commissioner said, as a law enforcement agency, they were determined to uphold all relevant laws that would ensure peaceful conduct of the local government election in the state. He however warned against breach of the existing peace in the state and said anyone found wanting will be dealt with according to the law. It would be recalled that 11 opposition political parties taking part in the council poll wrote stakeholders in the state saying they have lost confidence in the Gombe State Independent Electoral Commission (GOSIEC). While presenting the letter, state Chairman of the CPPP, Alhaji Magaji Kwairanga, prayed for the Police and other sister security agencies and the court which serves as the last resort for protection of justices and democracy, not to allow their agencies to be used in truncating the will of the people in the forth coming local government election in the state.
