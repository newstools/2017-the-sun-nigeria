From: Basil Obasi, Abuja The Ministry of Budget and National Planning has refuted the series of misleading information being given prominence in the media regarding some purported provisions in the 2017 budget proposals. A statement by  media aide to the Minister of Budget and National Planning, Senator Udoma Udo Udoma, , Mr. James Akpandem, bemoaned the series of false expositions about the 2017 budget making wave in the media, the latest being the false statement to the effect that a provision of N250 million has been made for the construction of a Gate-house in the Vice President’s quarters. The minister stated categorically that this information was completely false and unfounded as there was indeed no such provision even in the 2016 budget of the Federal Government nor was there any such provision in the 2017 draft budget currently being deliberated upon by the National Assembly. In view of the persistence of these allegations, the Director General of the budget Office, Mr. Ben Akabueze, will address journalists, on Thursday, to give further corrections and explanations regarding the provisions of the 2017 budget. It would be recalled that after the 2017 budget proposals were submitted by President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly; the Ministry announced that the proposals would be put up on the websites of both the Ministry of National Planning and the budget office of the federation. In compliance to that promise, the details of the proposals are already uploaded in the appropriate websites; we therefore encourage truth-loving Nigerians to check these details before repeating allegations, which may be completely deceitful.
