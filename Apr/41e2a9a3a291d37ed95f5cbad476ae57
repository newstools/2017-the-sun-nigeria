By Zika Bobby Shongai Packaging Industry Limited, a plastic packaging firm in Nigeria, in a bid to key into the Federal Government’s call on manufacturers to source raw materials locally for their production, has revealed that it currently imports near to nothing in manufacturing of its products. This, the company said, has helpd to create several job opportunities for Nigerians as well as boosted the country’s Gross Domestic Products (GDP). Executive Director of the company, Mr. G. C. Anyaso, said that about 98 per cent of the firm’s raw materials used in the production of its products are locally produced while a little fraction is imported. Anyaso noted that when goods are produced locally, it stems the dependence on imported products and eventually leads to a country becoming self-sufficient. He said producing high quality products is the competitive edge the company has used in winning customers and to remain relevant in the market. He added that the company’s products are classified into household and industrial segments, stating that the firm makes the biggest sales in industrial products in Lagos, Ogun, Ibadan and middle belt while its household products are sold in large quantities in Lagos and other parts of the country.
