Cross River State Government said it has achieved 92 per cent immunisation coverage across the 18 local government areas of the state in 2016. Commissioner for Health, Dr Inyang Asibong, disclosed this, on Monday, in an interview in Calabar. Asibong said that the figure was achieved through the sustained campaign and enlightenment programme carried out by her office to educate residents on the importance of immunisation. According to her, in 2016, the ministry deployed health workers to all nooks and crannies of the state for immunisation, adding that those deployed to the hard-to-reach areas were given special incentives for the job. “The state government has shown commitment in ensuring that Cross River is polio free. “We are happy to have recorded 92 per cent immunisation coverage in 2016. “We have flagged off the first round of the 2017 National Immunisation Plus Days in the state and we hope to achieve 100 per cent immunisation coverage across the state. “As a ministry, we will continue to provide logistics to enable health workers reach all nooks and crannies of the state for immunisation purposes,’’ she said. On the recent outbreak of Cerebro Spinal Meningitis (CSM) in some states, the commissioner advised residents to take precautionary measures to curb the spread. According to her, the state government is doing its best in line with the Federal Government to put an end to the spread. She urged residents to desist from living in overcrowded rooms, poorly ventilated houses and poor sanitary environment. The commissioner warned that such places were vulnerable to respiratory infections which encourage the survival of the bacteria. (NAN)
