the flexibility and versatility of closures make them applicable for just about all types of hair, whether natural, scanty, permed or less thrilling receding hairline. Our natural hair doesn’t always blend well with foreign textures like for instance Brazilian or Indian and as a result, some weaves tend to reveal breakage, bald spots and thinned edges. Closures and frontals can be used effectively to prevent such. What are closures you may ask?
Closures are one of the most revolutionary techniques in hair weaving history. They’re oblong or circle with hair attachment, so it can be placed on your hair in order to make your weave look more natural when rocking a full head of weave. They are of different types including:
Silk-based closures and Lace-based closures
Silk-based closures means the base of the closure is silk and lace-based closures means the base is lace.
Frontals
Frontals are incorporated with a weft to close a sew-in across the front hairline; hence the name frontals. They help to achieve the most natural full head weave or can be used to create a more affordable lace wig. Frontals need very experienced and creative stylist to achieve a perfect hairline; otherwise you wind up with overly perfect and unnatural hairline.
Frontal – closure
A frontal closure is the combination of both which means, it’s almost like a closure with thin skin around the perimeter but has the advantage of a frontal (having hair line)
Achieving a closure or frontals
Closures are generally sewn on and frontals are generally glued on.
