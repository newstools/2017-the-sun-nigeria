Prominent entertainers have thrown their weights behind KonFamD, a new application designed to enhance the lifestyle of mobile phone users in Nigeria.
KonfamD Mobile App is a GPS enabled application that connects partner merchants with prospective customers using real time and intelligent feedback. The artistes including Wande Coal, Ebiye, MC Makopolo, and OluwaDolarz among others were present at the press conference held in Lagos recently to announce the launch of the app. They were unanimous in their position that KonFamD is a springboard that will help grow their brands by giving them more visibility and followership.
Speaking during the launch of the mobile app, the Managing Director, KonfamD Limited, Tolu Ojosipe stated that KonfamD would combine commerce and entertainment in one platform that will enhance the lifestyle of its users.
He said: “KonfamD is changing the mobile digital space as we know it. The platform will not only help grow our entertainment sector by providing a platform for Nigerian musicians, comedians and other artistes to showcase their works and grow their brands, users of the app can watch entertaining, hilarious and informative skits and get paid for watching sponsored Ads skits”.
Ojosipe further stated that the KonfamD app would provide information on suitable merchants to patronize. “The app comes with a User category which has an M-directory that will help users locate and experience the services within their vicinity with a single click. In this section of the app, users get a list of already subscribed businesses and can read, share and write reviews of restaurants, clubs, bars, salons, spas, laundry, movie theaters and much more, all within their immediate location,” he explained.
KonfamD also provides amazing discounts at the outlets that are in partnership with the app. Partners that have already tapped into the app include Tastee Fried Chicken, Hardrock Café, Shaunz Bar, City Walk, Mint by Green and many others.
