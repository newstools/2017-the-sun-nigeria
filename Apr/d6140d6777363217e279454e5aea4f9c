By Zika Bobby Founder and General Overseer, Mountain of Liberation and Miracle Ministries (MLMM) aka Liberation City, Dr. Chris Okafor has made cash donation to victims of the xenophobic attack in South Africa. Okafor, who visited the Nigerian consulate in Johannesburg, said it is sad that such could be happening to Nigerians at this period. In company of the Consul General, Godwin A. Adama and the Minister (Consular & Immigration) at the Consulate, Anthony A. Ogbe, Okafor met with victims in Polokwane, a city in the Limpopo province, where a Nigerian was killed and many others injured. Elated Peter Idowu Kolawole, who almost lost his right leg to the attack, thanked Okafor for the visit and the donation. Kayode Showunmi, a fashion designer, who only a week before the attack arrived South Africa for the first time to visit his brother, Razak Ajao, told the cleric how he sustained machete cuts all over his body and almost lost his manhood. He said his brother was not so lucky, as he was killed, leaving behind his young widow, Basirat and four children. Raphael Nwachukwu, another victim who spoke on behalf of the victims, thanked the man of God for the cash donation and called on God to protect him. Okafor, who said he was overwhelmed with grief, said: “I never knew it was this bad. Nobody should have to go through this level of horror. We are brothers and should not do this to ourselves. If blacks are killing blacks, how can we then convince the world that ‘Black Lives Matter’? He offered prayers and made a donation of $7,000, promising to return with more money and relief materials for the victims.
