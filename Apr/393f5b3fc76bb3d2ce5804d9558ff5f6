Juventus is primed for revenge as they host  La Liga title holders Barcelona in a re-run of the 2015 finals today in quarter final of the Champions League today. The Italian giants have not won the Champions League since overcoming Ajax on penalties after a 1-1 draw in Rome’s Stadio Olimpico. But Massimiliano Allegri’s side will now look to avenge the 3-1 defeat by Barcelona during the Berlin final in June 2015, where goals from Ivan Rakitic, Luis Suarez and Neymar denied Juve a third European Cup. After Barcelona turned around a 4-0 deficit against Paris Saint-Germain in the last round, Juventus will not take anything for granted should they establish a commanding lead heading into the second leg, at the Nou Camp on April 19. With Luis Enrique’s arriving in Turin on Monday, Juventus have stepped up their preparations for the game in front of a sell-out crowd. The club’s chief goal threat for the visit of the Catalan giants will once more come from Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuain, who scored in Real Madrid’s 2-1 Spanish Super Cup victory over Barcelona in August 2012.
