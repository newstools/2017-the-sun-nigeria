The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is set to commence investigations into 153 complaints on hate speeches and election related violence recorded during the 2015 general elections. Acting Executive Secretary of the Commission, Mrs. Oti Ovrawah, disclosed this on Thursday in Abuja at a preliminary meeting, ahead of commencement of investigations into the complaints. Ovrawah said that substantiated hate speeches and election related violence would be subjected to public hearings across the 36 states of the federation, in order to give indicted persons a chance to defend themselves. She added that the investigations would have a positive influence on the 2019 general elections. Project Coordinator and Director, Monitoring in the Commission, Mr. Â Tony Ojukwu, assured that the NHRC would not hesitate to name and recommend for prosecution all those indicted. Ojukwu noted that the complaints on hate speeches and election related violence spread across the six geo-political zones of the country. He said that the investigations would take place from April 24 to April 27 across the states. (NAN)
