Nigerian international, Victor Moses has put behind him Chelsea’s 4-2 victory over Southampton in Tuesday’s English Premier League encounter at Stamford Bridge. The Blues extended their lead over Tottenham Hotspur to seven points after Diego Costa’s brace and strikes from Gary Cahill and Eden Hazard subdued the Saints. The delighted 26-year-old who was replaced by John Terry in the closing stages of the game appreciated his team’s effort, and stated he is focused on the game against sixth-placed Toffees at Goodison Park. ‘’Massive win last night and a crucial three points, time to focus now on Sunday’s game #CFC,’’ Moses tweeted. The Super Eagles star despite playing in a strange position this season has been a key figure in Antonio Conte’s squad – playing 30 times with three goals to his credit. A win for the Blues against Ronald Koeman’s men will take them closer to winning the diadem at the expense of closest challengers Spurs.
