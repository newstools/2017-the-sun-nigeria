• Blue Diamond boss makes case for implementation of trade agreements The CEO of Blue Diamond Logistics, China, one of the facilitators of the ongoing China-Nigeria Governors Investment Forum in Guangzhou, has called on governors attending the event to prevail on the government of China and other investors to begin implementations of trade agreement and Memoranda of Understanding entered into with Nigerian government during President Muhammadu Buhari’s state visit to China in April last year.
Mbisiogu told reporters, on his way to attend the event, that it behooves on the Nigeria delegation to ensure that last year’s recommendations and those that will be reached in the ongoing investment forum were implemented, especially now that Nigeria is looking for means to get out of economic recession.
He noted that it amount to effort in futility if these recommendations were not implemented.
The Blue Diamond boss said the purpose of the event include, to attract direct foreign investment to the country, jobs creation for our teeming youths and industrial revolution.
He advised the state executives to concentrate discussion on how private companies and the government China can explore the enormous resources Nigeria is endowed with which he said are lying fallow.
Mbisiogu reiterated the importance of steady power supply in an emerging economy like Nigeria, which is a major challenge to national development, but urged the governors to woo private companies and various levels of government in China to invest in the power sector.
He recall how, through his Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Good Governance Initiative (GGI), he has been advocating for steady power supply as the answer to unemployment and underdevelopment of the country, while expressing confidence that with over 18 governors in attendance, each state have the opportunity to showcase their potentials and the benefits of investing in the power sector.
He urged the governors to target Green Field Investment from China, as it will create employment and encourage transfer of skills to our youths without which the investment forum may be a mirage.
