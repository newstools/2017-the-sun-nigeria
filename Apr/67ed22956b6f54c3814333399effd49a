By Christopher Oji and Itoro Godwin Two persons died and many others injured when a truck rammed into another vehicle at the Ilasa area of Oshodi-Apapa express road, Lagos. Daily Sun gathered that the truck loaded with gravel, coming from the Oshodi side, was on high speed and rammed into another truck conveying vegetable oil. A woman, Joy Omeni, said the accident happened around 3am. According to her, “the two drivers of the vehicles were badly injured and their conductors were trapped and were rescued after one hour of intensive struggles by policemen from Ilasa division and Lagos State Emergency Agency (LASEMA) “The unexpected happened immediately after the rescue of the conductors and the injured were rushed to the hospital, when another truck on high speed rammed into another yellow bus conveying some passengers. “A policeman was knocked down. The yellow bus somersaulted. The conductor and one passenger died on the spot.” A police officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said “four persons died. I don’t see how the two drivers and the other conductor would survive the accident. Many others were badly injured. Our colleague who was knocked down broke his leg.” The accidents caused gridlock on the expressway, as the vehicle blocked the road and vegetable oil being conveyed by one of them spilled. Some motorists, who mistook the oil to be fuel, made detour, causing heavy traffic. Officials of LASEMA and the Lagos State Traffic Management Agency (LASTMA) later evacuated the vehicles and cleaned the oil. As at press time the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Ilasa Division, SP Titilayo Oriyomi and her team were on the ground maintaining peace.
