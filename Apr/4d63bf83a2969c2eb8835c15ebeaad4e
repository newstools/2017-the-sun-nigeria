Opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has taken a swipe at the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government on its anti-corruption campaign. The PDP, on Wednesday, said the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission’s anti-graft war under the President Muhammadu Buhari administration has become a comedy. The PDP in a series of tweets on its Twitter handle, @OfficialPDPNig, noted that the EFCC was established by the Chief Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration “to fight corruption effectively & efficiently and not to entertain Nigerians.” The party was reacting to the discovery of $43.4 million, N23.2 million and £27,000 by the anti-graft agency in an apartment at Osborne Towers in Ikoyi, Lagos, last week. Prior to that, the agency had also allegedly discovered another N49m at Kaduna Airport, N448 million at LEGICO Mall, and N250m in Balogun Market. The EFCC has yet to link the monies to their owners — a situation which the opposition PDP described as “preposterous” and “embarrassing.” “The anti-corruption fight under the APC govt has become a comedy. The EFCC now discovers funds in apartments and offices that have no owners,” the PDP tweeted. “It is preposterous to imagine that the last four seizures coincidentally have no known owners. This is most unfortunate and embarrassing,” it tweeted. “Who are the owners of N49 million at Kaduna Airport, N448 million at LEGICO Mall, N250 million in Balogun Market and $43.4m, N23.2 million & £27,000 in Osborne Road? “The EFCC must also tell Nigerians the total amount they have recovered in the last 2 years & provide verifiable accounts of recovered funds,” the PDP wrote.
