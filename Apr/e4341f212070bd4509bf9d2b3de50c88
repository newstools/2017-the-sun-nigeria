The 14 students of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) detained at the Kirikiri prisons have been set free from detention. The students were allegedly detained for protesting against the university authorities. The students, who were remanded at the Kirikiri prison, on Saturday, on the order of a court, arrived the mobile court in Oshodi, on Thursday morning. The students arrived in a police convoy chanting solidarity songs. The 14 students were taken into custody on the orders of the Special Offences Mobile Court, Oshodi, where they were arraigned by the police for “riotous invasion” of Lagos-based Television Continental, TVC. The management of the station has since denied the allegations, saying the students were peaceful in their conduct. They had earlier been arrested on the university campus while protesting the suspension of a visually-impaired student and demanding the reinstatement of all suspended student activists. The UNILAG authorities had earlier denounced the students saying some of them had been rusticated from the school while others were not students of the institution. Several groups including the National Association of Nigerian Students and Education Rights Campaign had condemned the detention of the students‎. The counsel to the students, Inibihehe Effiong, said the release was subject to Section 211 of the Nigerian constitution. “The trumped up charges have been struck out and we salute the Lagos State Government for this,” he said. One of the 14 students, Aina Tomi, disclosed that the students would institute a legal suit against the Lagos state Commissioner of Police, Fatai Owoseni. “We will institute legal action against the commissioner in the next couple of days”, he said.
