*Says no court order ordering forfeiture of his property From: FRED ITUA, Abuja Sen. Peter Nwaoboshi, on Tuesday, debunked reports indicating that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) secured a forfeiture order from a Federal High Court in Lagos on his 12-storey Lagos building at 27 Marine Road Apapa. Nwaoboshi’s clarification on the reports published by some national dailies, was made in a statement issued to that effect by his senior media assistant, Onyeluka Igbonoba. According to the senator, the anti-graft agency has not in any way secured an order from the court legalizing the seizure of the said property as erroneously reported and illegally being carried out by it. He said the order EFCC got from a Lagos High Court on the property was an attachment and not a forfeiture order as being presented to the public. The statement reads in part: “The attention of Senator Peter Nwaoboshi has been drawn to media reports on a ruling by a Federal High Court in Lagos which granted an attachment order on a property situate on 27 Marine Road, Apapa Lagos but being portrayed as forfeiture order. “EFCC has since one month ago sealed the said Property without a court order. Its counsel, Yetunde Alabi appeared before the Federal High Court in Asaba on the 13th of April, 2017 on the subject matter but pleaded with the court for adjournment which was graciously granted by adjourning to 25th of April 2017 (yesterday).”‎ The Senator however welcome investigation being carried out on the said property by EFCC, the outcome of which he said would clear him of acquiring the property through any  fraudulent means.
