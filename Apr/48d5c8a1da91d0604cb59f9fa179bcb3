The Inspector General of Police, IGP Ibrahim Idris has deployed Special X-Squad Teams across the country to commence with effect from Monday the removal of all forms of illegal blockage of highways and roads, and other obstructions. Most of such blocks are created and operated by unlawful revenue/tax collectors, road transport unions, labour and trade related unions inhibiting vehicle  movement and smooth passage of passengers and goods, and other road users across the country. The Special X-Squad Teams deployed are under strict instructions to also arrest, investigate and prosecute any person or group of persons found committing this illegal act. It is unlawful and contrary to the laws for any individual, or group under any name to take laws into their hands and block any Road or Highway in full or any part of it under the guise of collection of Revenue/Tax or enforcement of the interests of such organisations. For avoidance of doubt, the Taxes and Levies act, Laws of Federation of Nigeria 2004 section 2 (2) disallowed any person, including a Tax Authority from mounting a Road block in any part of the Federation for the purposes of collecting any Tax or Levy. Consequently, the Nigeria Police  advised the state and local governments,, Boards of Internal Revenue service across the country, transport unions, labour and traders associations that it is against the law for any organization to create  blockade and restrict free usage of rand highways anywhere in the country.
