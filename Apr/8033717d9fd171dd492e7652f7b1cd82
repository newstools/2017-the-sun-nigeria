The applause inside the big Marquee of Balmoral Event Centre, Oregun, Ikeja, Lagos was deafening as members of the Malaika Fuji Band led by Sulaimon Alao Adekunle performed at the Excellence Recognition Awards held recently.
It was a deserving reaction as the crowd demanded for an encore even after the allocated time of performance was up. The sonorous voice of the leader backed by the band men as well as their electrifying dance steps and dexterity on the various instruments were the main attractions for the audience, just like the band had done at various cultural festivals and concerts both within and outside Nigeria.
As one of the most widely travelled and equally talented fuji groups in Nigeria, Sule Alao Adekunle and the Malaika Fuji Band commands wide followership among both the elites and the grassroots. With a 27-man band made up of drummers (sakara, apala, iyailu), percussionists (omele, chord, maracas), saxophonists, guitarists, keyboardist and vocalists aside from other support staff, Malaika Fuji Band has shown over the years that it is a force to reckon with.
Recently, the Malaika Band was also a hit among the guests at the Dammy Krane’s Amin Concert held inside the ultra-modern Ultima Studios, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos. At the concert, Malaika, the only fuji music band on the list, wowed the over 1000 guests with contemporary music vibes from its repertoire including Proper Music, Special Day and Original.
