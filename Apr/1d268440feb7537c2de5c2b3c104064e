Rector of Federal Polytechnic Mubi, in Adamawa, Dr. Sadiq Yahya, has urged the Federal Government to introduce Bachelor of Technology (B-Tech) degree programme in Nigerian polytechnics. Yahya gave the advice on Thursday in an interview. The Rector said the programme would reduce pressure on Nigerian universities as well as develop more manpower needed for the industrialisation of the country. He also said that the programme would not consummate the potential in the existing Higher National Diploma (HND) certificates, but would rather produce knowledge-based manpower in Nigeria. He said students would be admitted into the B-Tech programme after the completion of their diploma programmes. He expressed concern that the high level of unemployment in the country was due to lack of skills-based education which was more acquired from the polytechnics. According to him, polytechnic education gives graduates skills to make them self- reliant. “It has become so obvious that most of our tertiary school applicants do apply for university admissions. “It is not wrong for our youths to seek university admissions but our universities are inadequate to satisfy the huge number of applicants. “The solution is to introduce Bachelor of Technology degrees in polytechnics to be run side by side with the higher national diplomas. “The skillful oriented education will also address the challenge posed by unemployment, because it will bequeath graduates with skills that can make them self-reliant. “With this, admission in to either B-Tech or HND will become a matter of choice to candidates,’ Yahya said. The rector also called for scientific research that would address challenges of the immediate environment. (NAN)
