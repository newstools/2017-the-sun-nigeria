The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), on Wednesday, said it would deploy no fewer than 100 personnel for the Easter Special Patrol on the Benin-Ore-Sagamu expressway. FRSC Unit Commander in Ore, Ondo State, Mr Umoru Abdullahi said, in Ore, that mobile courts would also be in place to try traffic offenders. Abdullahi said the measure was to check the excesses of motorists and prevent road crashes during the Easter celebrations. “Let me assure the public that over 100 personnel and mobile courts will be deployed on the Benin-Ore-Sagamu expressway to ensure that motorists comply with traffic rules. “We will monitor reckless driving, over-speeding, overloading, expired tyres, driving without seat belts, and phone calls while driving. “We will also monitor driving without driver’s licence and non-installation of speed limiters, especially, on commercial vehicles,’’ he said. The FRSC officer urged motorists to be patient and to drive safely to avert danger and road crashes usually caused by human error. (NAN)
