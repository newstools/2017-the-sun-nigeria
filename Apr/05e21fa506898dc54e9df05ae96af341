Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel has revealed Marc Bartra will be out for around four weeks from the arm injury sustained in the bombings near the team bus.
The German coach has also described the aftermath of Tuesday night’s explosions as his “worst day ever”.
Dortmund were travelling to the Signal Iduna Park for their Champions League quarter-final with Monaco when the attack took place.
Bartra was hit by shrapnel as the explosions hit the coach and required surgery on a broken bone in his wrist.
And the Dortmund boss, whose side face Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga on Saturday, said “it looks like Marc Bartra will return to the team in four weeks. He’d like to play now already.”
He added that him and his squad remain shaken by the suspected terrorist plot.
He said: “I just can speak for myself, I just can tell you that today is my worst day, ever.
“This morning and till now and speaking again to the players this and for myself feels like the worst day.
“While it was happening it was kind of.. ‘ok’ – nobody knew what was going on and you just have to do that you have to do and the next day was a bit like walking through a cloud.
“It was not so clear and I think this is a process that will accompany us through the next days and weeks that we have to accept that it comes up and goes down and it comes in waves and sometimes you get very emotional about it and sometimes you can feel this moment very realistic and sometimes it’s far away.”
The Dortmund manager said UEFA told his side to play the rearranged first leg game just 24 hours later, which they lost 3-2 to the French side, and claims they were informed via text message. Click Here>>>>>>Anti-kidnap and anti-theft device for tracking and listening<<<<<<
