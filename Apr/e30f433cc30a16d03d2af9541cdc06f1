From: Agaju Madugba, Katsina At least three persons are currently nursing gunshot wounds following a scuffle with men of the Nigerian Customs yesterday along the Katsina-Daura road. Eyewitness accounts said that the incident took place at about 6.30 am, on Thursday, as Customs officers on duty at the Tuna district of the area, barricaded the road and allegedly started shooting sporadically on sighting seven vehicles suspected to be loaded with smuggled rice. Unconfirmed report said one of the suspected smugglers was killed on the spot while another identified as Rabe was shot in the stomach and his intestines ripped open. As at the time of this report, Rabe was being treated at the K-Dara private hospital in Katsina. Reports said that two other suspected smugglers, Aminu and Aliyu, were shot on the arm and thigh, respectively, and were treated at the Katsina General Hospital. But when contacted, the Controller of the Katsina/Kaduna command of Customs, Mohammad Jaafar Tanko, denied that his men shot the suspects. He attributed injuries sustained by the victims to  “confusion”, saying that they “started hitting themselves as they tried to run.” “But we were able to apprehend all the seven vehicles loaded with smuggled rice. “The matter has been reported to the police and the injured have been taken to hospital and receiving treatment. As soon as they get better we are prosecuting the matter, to serve as deterrent to others,” Tanko said. He reaffirmed the determination of the Customs to zero-in on smuggling of rice and other items not allowed by government. When contacted to shed more light on the incident, spokesman for the state’s police Command, DSP Gambo Isah, said inquiries on the matter should be directed at the Customs.
