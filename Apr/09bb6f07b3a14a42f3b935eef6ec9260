Newly-elected Hong Kong Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, will receive her formal appointment for the island’s top job from Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, on Tuesday, the Office of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs of China’s State Council said, on Monday. Lam, considered the pro-Beijing candidate in last month’s election, will also meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, the Office added. She began her four-day trip to Beijing on Monday meeting with Wang Guangya, the director of the Hong Kong office. She was also scheduled to meet with the head of the Chinese parliament, Zhang Dejiang, at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. Lam, formerly Hong Kong’s second-highest-ranking official, won the election with 777 of 1,163 votes of an electoral committee made of legislators, heads of professional associations and representatives of various economic sectors. She defeated the city’s former finance secretary and a retired judge. Lam is backed by Beijing but opposed by pro-democracy groups in the former British colony. She is working to select the members of her cabinet, which will be sworn in on July 1. (NAN)
