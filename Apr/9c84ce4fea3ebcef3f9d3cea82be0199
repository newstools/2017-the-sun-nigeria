From Gyang Bere, Jos Plateau Sate Governor, Simon Lalong said he will receive Mr. Michael Ejegba, popularly known as ‘Efe’,  the winner of Big Brother Naija (BBN) TV Reality Show, as the newest ambassador of the State in the entertainment and creative industry, on his arrival from South Africa soon. Lalong, in a statement signed by his Director of Press, Emmanuel Nanle, said the victory of Efe is a prove of brotherhood, excellence, courage and determination that characterises the Plateau Spirit. The governor had admonished Plateau citizens to stand in solidarity with Efe by voting and mobilising others to vote for the home grown actor, who was at the verge of joining the team of successful Plateau citizens. He urged Plateau people to ensure that the value they place on the common humanity of her citizens in a multi cultural and cosmopolitan setting, is always seen in the unity of purpose exhibited by all in the collective pursuit of a common goal. Lalong added that although Efe, is by ethnic extraction, from Delta State, Plateau is proud to lay claim to his entire life’s orientation, having been groomed for excellence in life with the values that distinguish the Plateau person. He said the victory of Efe provides an additional platform for the consolidation of the relationship between the people of Plateau and Delta state, which had existed right from the early tin mining days of the 20th century. The governor further confirmed he will be receiving Efe as the newest ambassador of the State in the entertainment and creative industry on his arrival from South Africa soon.
