From: MAGNUS EZE, Abuja Director-General of Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Mr. José Graziano da Silva will, on Friday, in Maidugiri, hold discussions with Governor Kashim Shettima of Borno State as well as the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh during his visit to communities in the troubled Northeastern part of the country and the Lake Chad Basin. The visit is to highlight the need to support local efforts to increase the resilience of people in rural areas whose agriculture-based livelihoods have been disrupted by recurrent crises in the region. Information released in Abuja by FAO National Communication Officer, Mr. Emeka Anuforo, disclosed that da Silva is also scheduled to meet farmers at several FAO-supported farms at Gongulong and Old Maiduguri, near Maiduguri. Before meeting Nigerian officials, the FAO DG will on Thursday meet the Chadian leader, Idriss Deby, in Ndjamena. FAO’s long-term strategy for the Lake Chad region puts a special emphasis on supporting refugees, internally displaced families and host communities, as these are the most vulnerable groups in this crisis. According to the statement, “Interventions are geared to improving their food security and nutrition and building their resilience so they are better equipped to handle future shocks. In addition, restoring agriculture-based livelihoods will offer a unique opportunity to pave the way to recovery and peace in the affected areas.” Graziano will be accompanied on the visit by FAO Assistant Director-General/Regional Representative for Africa, Bukar Tijani and Strategic Programme Leader-Resilience/Director, Emergencies and Rehabilitation Division, Dominique Burgeon.
