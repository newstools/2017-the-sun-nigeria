 From: Paul Osuyi, Asaba Two persons have been arrested for complicity in the rape of a 15-year old Princess and secondary school student (names withheld) at the palace of the Obi of Idumuje-Ugboko, Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State. The suspects were reportedly arrested at the premises of a Magistrates Court in Asaba, after several unsuccessful attempts by the police to pin them down. A source at the state police command headquarters in Asaba said efforts were still on to arrest the principal suspect so as to unravel the true position concerning the case that had attracted reactions from various segments of the society. The source said the arrested suspects made statement to the police and were detained while investigation continued, adding that the arrests reduced tension in the agrarian community. Investigation into the case was spurred by a petition written by Walter Eziashi, a former President-General of Idumuje-Ugboko Development Union, alleging that after the rape, some royal princess and others covered up the case after sanctioning the suspect and imposing fine of four goats and the sum of N400,000 on him. The alarm raised by Mr. Eziashi also attracted female lawyers in Nigeria, under the aegis of FIDA, and they called for thorough investigation to give justice to the teenager. Public Relations Officer (PRO), FIDA, Delta State, Mrs. Stellamaris Mejulu, expressed delight with the arrest of the suspects and urged the police to prosecute all those linked to the case. But Police Public Relations Officer of the command, Mr. Andrew Aniemeka kept sealed lips over the arrest, saying that the matter was still investigating the case.
