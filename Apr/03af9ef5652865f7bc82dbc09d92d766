The Gombe State Malaria Control Office, on Tuesday, said it had distributed anti-malaria drugs free to students of Gombe State University (GSU) diagnosed of malaria. Gombe State Malaria Control Manager, Malam Muhammad Babagana, disclosed this to newsmen in Gombe. He said that the gesture was in commemoration of 2017 World Malaria Day. According to him, the students were screened and those found with malaria parasites were given anti-malaria drugs free of charge. Babagana said that the office had also distributed 150 Long Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLINs) to students. He said the state government was creating awareness on effects of malaria and how students could protect themselves. Babagana said the state government had also inspected the sanitary condition of students’ hostels and had applied some chemicals. He said the state government was giving the office some drugs to treat those that were infected. According to him, anti-malaria drugs are given to pregnant women at ante-natal clinics to prevent malaria. “The support is not like the years back when we had the full support of the World Bank for Malaria Control Booster Project. “We are appealing to government to do more because we do not have many activities in the office now. “We want to sustain what the World Bank has left, ’’ he said. Babagana appealed to the general public to always keep their environment clean as part of malaria prevention. The theme of the 2017 World Malaria Day is: “End Malaria for Good’’. (NAN)
