From Okey Sampson, Aba It was end of the road for two armed robbery suspects shot dead yesterday by a combined team of army and police personnel in Aba, Abia State. Daily Sun gathered that a gang of suspected armed robbers had, yesterday, morning snatched a Toyota SUV with registration number, EPE 568 EM from David Ogbole and drove towards the city centre. On getting to the Railway Crossing, between Eziukwu/Factory and Aba-Owerri road, the hoodlums were accosted by the policemen, who were later joined by some soldiers. The men of the under world opened fire on the police and in the ensuing gun duel that lasted for over 30 minutes, two of the hoodlums were reportedly killed on the spot, while two others were arrested. Others escaped. The incident, according to a witness, caused gridlock on the ever-busy Aba-Owerri Road, as motorists abandoned their vehicles and scampered for safety. It took over one hour for free flow of traffic to be restored. Sources at the Aba Area Command said two vehicles used by the hoodlums were recovered by the police, with the help of soldiers. Also recovered from the gang was a locally made pistol with a cartridge. It was gathered that one of the gang members was thereafter arrested where he was receiving treatment for the gunshot injury sustained on his right hand.
